         "Previous observational studies focused on the association of coffee consumption and neurological disease. However, it is not known whether these associations are causal.We used Mendelian randomization (MR) study to assess the causal relationship of coffee intake with the risk of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, stroke, and migraine. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which had genetic statistical significance with coffee intake were used as instrumental variable (IV). Genetic instruments were stretched from the MRC-IEU (MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit) analysis on the UK Biobank. We performed MR analyses using the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method as the main approach. Sensitivity analyses were further performed using MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO to assess the robustness.In the MR analysis, 40 SNPs were selected as IV, the F statistics for all SNPs ranged from 16 to 359. In IVW approach, our results provide genetic evidence supporting a potential causal association between coffee intake and a lower risk of migraine (OR = 0.528, 95% CI = 0.342-0.817, P = 0.004) and migraine with aura (OR = 0.374, 95% CI = 0.208-0.672, P = 0.001). However, we found no significant association between coffee intake and other neurological diseases along with their subtypes in this MR study.Using genetic data, our MR study found significant evidence supporting a causal association between coffee intake and migraine. This suggests that coffee consumption is likely a trigger or a prevention strategy for migraine.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",

         "Previous studies have observed relationships between immune cells and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but their causal links remain undetermined. Based on the public available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics, we conducted two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to evaluate the associations between 731 immune phenotypes and SLE pairs. Pairwise pleiotropy analysis was performed to identify pleiotropic genes for significant immunophenotype-SLE pairs. A comprehensive gene function analysis was undertaken to explore the mechanisms of immune cells in SLE. By using the instrumental variables extracted from GWAS data, we observed that increased levels of five immune phenotypes were causally associated with SLE risk (FDR < 0.05), that were CD20 on IgD+ CD38- naïve, BAFF-R on IgD+ CD38dim, CD39+ secreting Treg AC, CD14- CD16+ monocyte AC, and HLA DR on CD14+ monocyte. Pairwise gene-based analyses identified a total of 38 pleiotropic genes for 5 significant pairs identified and gene set enrichment analysis revealed the involvement of the identified pleiotropic genes in complex pathways (i.e., systemic lupus erythematosus, an integral component of luminal side of endoplasmic reticulum membrane, C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway and regulation of hormone secretion). This study demonstrates that the immune response influences the progression of SLE in a complex pattern. These findings greatly improve our understanding of the interaction between immune response and SLE risk and also aid in the design of therapeutic strategies from an immunological perspective.© 2023.

         "Based on the findings of current observational studies, asthma and inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) are associated; however, their causal association cannot be established due to methodological limitations.we use two-sample bidirectional mendelian randomization (MR) to overcome the confounding factors and explore the causal link between asthma and inflammatory bowel disease.After selecting asthma and IBD-related genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data and screening single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), MR analysis was performed by four methods: inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, maximum likelihood, and weighted median (WM), while Cochran's Q test was used to detect heterogeneity and MR-Egger intercept to detect horizontal pleiotropy. Finally, we used the leave-one-out method and funnel plot to perform sensitivity analysis.We screened 57, 59, and 60 SNPs in the association analysis of asthma and IBD, CD, and UC, respectively. The results of MR analysis showed that asthma only increased the risk of CD (IVW: OR = 1.1712, 95% CI = 1.0418-1.3167, P value = 0.0082; maximum likelihood: OR = 1.1739, 95% CI = 1.0428-1.3215, P value = 0.0080). Neither forward nor reverse MR analysis revealed heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy. Similarly, we did not find potential directional pleiotropy by funnel plot, and the leave-one-out method did not suggest a significant effect of a single SNP on the overall results.we found a negative correlation between asthma and Crohn's disease, but more research is needed to confirm this.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

         "Previous researches have demonstrated a connection between psychiatric disorders and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), but the cause-and-effect relationship is still unclear. To that goal, the mendelian randomization (MR) method was used to study the causal link between psychiatric disorders and CVDs.Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data were collected for four CVDs, including coronary artery disease (n = 547,261), atrial fibrillation (n = 537,409), heart failure (n = 977,323) and ischemic stroke (n = 440,328). Summary data for four psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder (n = 51,710), major depressive disorder (n = 480,359), schizophrenia (n = 127,906) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (n = 55,374), came from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC). All participants were European. The IVW method was mainly used, and the reliability of the results was increased using sensitivity analyses such as MR-Egger, Cochrane's Q test, MR-PRESSO and leave-one-out.MR revealed that the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was linked to an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (OR, 1.085; 95% CI, 1.021-1.153; P = 0.008), heart failure (OR, 1.117; 95% CI, 1.044-1.195; P = 0.001), and ischemic stroke (OR, 1.146; 95% CI, 1.052-1.248; P = 0.002). The schizophrenia was linked to an increased risk of heart failure (OR, 1.035; 95% CI, 1.006-1.066; P = 0.017), but was found to be suggestively inverse associated with coronary artery disease (OR, 0.969; 95% CI, 0.941-0.997; P = 0.03). The major depressive disorder was associated with higher odds of coronary artery disease (OR, 1.109; 95% CI, 1.018-1.208; P = 0.018), while the bipolar disorder was linked to a reduced incidence of coronary artery disease (OR, 0.894; 95% CI, 0.831-0.961; P = 0.002) and heart failure (OR, 0.889; 95% CI, 0.829-0.955; P = 0.001). There were no clear relationships between other psychiatric disorders and CVDs.The results provide genetic proof of a possible causal relationship between psychiatric disorders and CVDs. These results imply that psychiatric disorders may be the cause of some CVDs, and that some abnormal mental states may increase or reduce the likelihood of CVDs, providing guidance for the CVDs prevention.© 2023 The Authors.",

         "The positive relationships of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cirrhosis with liver cancer were shown in previous observational studies, while further Mendelian randomization (MR) investigations are needed to confirm the possible causal associations.This study aimed to explore whether NAFLD and cirrhosis were causally related to liver cancer using MR in European and East Asian populations.For European populations, NAFLD data were obtained from a genome-wide meta-analysis (8434 patients and 770 180 controls). The data on chronic elevation of alanine aminotransferase (cALT), a proxy of NAFLD, were derived from Million Veteran Program (68 725 patients and 95 472 controls). Cirrhosis data were collected from two sources: a genome-wide association study of five cohorts (4829 patients and 72 705 controls) and FinnGen (1931 patients and 216 861 controls). Liver cancer data were collected from FinnGen (304 patients and 174 006 controls). For East Asian populations, the data on cirrhosis (2184 patients and 210 269 controls) and hepatocellular carcinoma (1866 patients and 195 745 controls) were obtained from Biobank Japan. Three, 41, seven, six, and three single-nucleotide polymorphisms were used for NAFLD (European), cALT (European), cirrhosis (European-five cohorts), cirrhosis (European-FinnGen), and cirrhosis (East Asian), respectively. We used inverse-variance weighted as the primary method to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Among European populations, genetically-predicted NAFLD, cALT, cirrhosis (five cohorts), and cirrhosis (FinnGen) were positively associated with liver cancer, with ORs (95% CIs) of 6.62 (3.81-11.50) (p < .001), 2.59 (1.70-3.94) (p < .001), 3.38 (2.41-4.75) (p < .001), and 2.62 (1.20-5.72) (p = .015). Among East Asian populations, there was also a positive association between genetically-predicted cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (OR = 2.12; 95% CI = 1.78-2.52; p < .001).This study utilized MR to complementarily confirm the positive connections of NAFLD and cirrhosis with liver cancer, as identified in earlier observational research. Subsequent MR investigations involving more liver cancer cases are needed.© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Reports published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.",

         "Objective: This study aims to explore the causal relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) using bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR). Methods: The genetic data related to OSA were obtained from the FinnGen Biobank (Ncase=16, 761, Ncontrol=201, 194) in the Genome-wide association study (GWAS). Three single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) were screened out as instrumental variable (IV) of OSA. The genetic data related to T2D were derived from a large Meta-analysis of GWAS (Ncase=62, 892, Ncontrol=596, 424), 114 SNP were selected as IV of T2D. Multiple MR methods were used for analysis and inverse variance weighted (IVW) was performed as main method. The sensitivity of MR analytic results was analyzed using MR-Egger and other methods, and the IV was evaluated using F-value statistics. Results: MR analysis showed that OSA was significantly associated with increased risk of T2D (OR=2.016, 95%CI: 1.185-3.429, P<0.05). There was no significant relationship between T2D and OSA risk (OR=1.030, 95%CI: 0.980-1.082, P=0.238). There was heterogeneity in both-way results (OSA➝T2D, P=1.808×10-11; T2D➝OSA, P=1.729×10-7), and no horizontal pleiotropy (OSA➝T2D, P=0.477; T2D➝OSA, P=0.349). IV of OSA and T2D-selected in the study were strong instrumental variables (F statistics of OSA=20.543; F statistics of T2D=30.117). Conclusion: Our results supported that OSA was a risk factor for T2D, but T2D had no significant impact on the incidence of OSA. Blood glucose monitoring and diabetes screening in OSA patients might be beneficial to the early detection and intervention of T2D.",

         "With the development and popularization of low-dose chest CT technology, the diagnosis and survival rates of patients with early lung cancer (LC) have significantly improved. The occurrence of colorectal cancer (CRC) as the second primary cancer (SPC) in primary lung cancer (PLC) survivors has become an essential factor affecting the prognosis of early LC. This study explored the potential association between PLC and CRC genetically, laying a foundation for developing SPC-CRC prevention strategies after primary early LC.Based on a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) design, this study systematically screened genetic instrumental variables (IVs) based on the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of PLC and CRC, applied inverse variance weighted (IVW) as the main method to assess the incidence association between the two cancers, and used a variety of other MR methods for supplementary analysis. Finally, the Genetic Risk Scores (GRS) method was used for secondary analysis to verify the results robustness further.From LC to CRC forward MR analysis, 20 genetic IVs of overall LC, 15 genetic IVs of squamous cell lung carcinoma (LUSC), and 10 genetic IVs of adenocarcinoma of the lung (LUAD) were screened. In the reverse MR analysis from CRC to LC, 47 genetic IVs for overall CRC, 37 for colon cancer, and 25 for rectal cancer were screened. The IVW method and a variety of MR methods all found that overall LC and CRC were significantly associated at the genetic level. Subgroup analysis also showed that LUSC was associated with CRC. And the results of the GRS method were consistent with those of the main analysis, confirming the robustness of the study. Our MR study found an association between LC and CRC, with an increased risk of SPC-CRC following PLC, especially LUSC. Our study provides an essential basis for the precise prevention of SPC-CRC after PLC, suggesting that we should pay more attention to the population with a history of PLC in clinical work, and pay close attention to the incidence of SPC-CRC, and carry out intervention and treatment as soon as possible.© 2023.

         "Atrial fibrillation (AF) can increase thrombosis, especially arterial thrombosis, and some studies show that AF patients have a higher risk of developing pulmonary embolism (PE). The objective of our study is to investigate whether there is a direct causal effect of AF on PE. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach was utilized to determine whether there is a causal relationship between AF and PE. European population-based consortia provided statistical data on the associations between Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and relevant traits. The AF dataset was obtained from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) comprising 60,620 cases and 970,216 controls, while a GWAS of 1846 cases and 461,164 controls identified genetic variations associated with PE. Estimation of the causal effect was mainly performed using the random effects inverse-variance weighted method (IVW). Additionally, other tests such as MR-Egger intercept, MR-PRESSO, Cochran's Q test, \"Leave-one-out,\" and funnel plots were conducted to assess the extent of pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Using 70 SNPs, there was no evidence to suggest an association between genetically predicted AF and risk of PE with multiplicative random-effects IVW MR analysis (odds ratio = 1.0003, 95% confidence interval: 0.9998-1.0008, P = 0.20). A null association was also observed in other methods. MR-Egger regression and MR-PRESSO respectively showed no evidence of directional (intercept, - 2.25; P = 0.94) and horizontal(P-value in the global heterogeneity test = 0.99) pleiotropic effect across the genetic variants. No substantial evidence was found to support the causal role of AF in the development of PE.© 2023.

Our study aimed to explore the causal relationship between GM composition and gout, as well as SUA levels, utilizing a two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach. A total of 196 GM taxa from five levels were available for analysis. We identified five taxa associated with SUA levels and 10 taxa associated with gout. In reverse MR analysis, we discovered that gout affected the composition of five GM taxa, while SUA levels influenced the composition of 30 GM taxa. Combining existing research, our study unveiled a potential negative feedback loop between phylum Actinobacteria and SUA levels, establishing connections with gout. We also proposed two novel associations connecting GM taxa (genus Faecalibacterium and genus Prevotella9), SUA levels, and gout. These findings provide compelling evidence of causal relationships between specific GM taxa with SUA levels and gout, contributing valuable insights for the treatment of gout.",

We conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to examine the bidirectional causality between the gut microbiota (211 taxa, including 131 genera, 35 families, 20 orders, 16 classes and 9 phyla; N = 18,340 individuals) and age-independent/dependent longitudinal changes in brain structure across the lifespan (N = 15,640 individuals aged 4~99 years). We identified causal associations between the gut microbiota and age-independent/dependent longitudinal changes in brain structure, such as family Peptostreptococcaceae with age-independent longitudinal changes of cortical gray matter (GM) volume and genus Faecalibacterium with age-independent average cortical thickness and cortical GM volume. Taking age-independent longitudinal changes in brain structure across the lifespan as exposures, there were causal relationships between the surface area and genus Lachnospiraceae. Our findings may serve as fundamentals for further research on the genetic mechanisms and biological treatment of complex traits and diseases associated with the gut microbiota and the brain structure change rate.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether PUFAs have a causal effect on DR. PUFAs- (total and omega-3 [FAw3] and omega-6 [FAw6] fatty acids and their ratio) and DR-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms derived from genome-wide association studies; sample sizes were 114,999 for fatty acids and 216,666 for any DR (ADR), background DR (BDR), severe non-proliferative DR (SNPDR), and proliferative DR (PDR). We hypothesized that the intra-body levels of PUFAs have an impact on DR and conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to assess the causality. Pleiotropy, heterogeneity, and sensitivity analyses were performed to verify result reliability. High levels of PUFAs were found to be associated with reduced risk of both ADR and PDR. Moreover, FAw3 was associated with a decreased risk of PDR, whereas FAw6 demonstrated an association with lowered risks of both BDR and PDR. Our findings provide genetic evidence, for the first time, for a causal relationship between PUFAs and reduced DR risk. Consequently, our comprehensive MR analysis strongly urges further investigation into the precise functions and long-term effects of PUFAs, FAw3, and FAw6 on DR.",

         "Osteoporosis, which is a bone disease, is characterized by low bone mineral density and an increased risk of fractures. The heel bone mineral density is often used as a representative measure of overall bone mineral density. Lipid metabolism, which includes processes such as fatty acid metabolism, glycerol metabolism, inositol metabolism, bile acid metabolism, carnitine metabolism, ketone body metabolism, sterol and steroid metabolism, etc., may have an impact on changes in bone mineral density. While some studies have reported correlations between lipid metabolism and heel bone mineral density, the overall causal relationship between metabolites and heel bone mineral density remains unclear.to investigate the causal relationship between lipid metabolites and heel bone mineral density using two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis.Summary-level data from large-scale genome-wide association studies were extracted to identify genetic variants linked to lipid metabolite levels. These genetic variants were subsequently employed as instrumental variables in Mendelian randomization analysis to estimate the causal effects of each lipid metabolite on heel bone mineral density. Furthermore, metabolites that could potentially be influenced by causal relationships with bone mineral density were extracted from the KEGG and WikiPathways databases. The causal associations between these downstream metabolites and heel bone mineral density were then examined. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the robustness of the results and address potential sources of bias.A total of 130 lipid metabolites were analyzed, and it was found that acetylcarnitine, propionylcarnitine, hexadecanedioate, tetradecanedioate, myo-inositol, 1-arachidonoylglycerophosphorine, 1-linoleoylglycerophoethanolamine, and epiandrosterone sulfate had a causal relationship with heel bone mineral density (p < 0.05). Furthermore, our findings also indicate an absence of causal association between the downstream metabolites associated with the aforementioned metabolites identified in the KEGG and WikiPathways databases and heel bone mineral density.This work supports the hypothesis that lipid metabolites have an impact on bone health through demonstrating a causal relationship between specific lipid metabolites and heel bone mineral density. This study has significant implications for the development of new strategies to osteoporosis prevention and treatment.",

Furthermore, increased BT levels were associated with an elevated risk of PCa (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.06-1.24). Importantly, our analysis revealed a unidirectional causal effect-higher BMI was linked to lower BT levels (beta = -0.27, 95% CI: -0.3--0.24), but not the other way around. This suggests that BT may mediate the effect of BMI on PCa rather than confound it. Our multivariable MR results further demonstrated that considering BT as a mediator led to the weakening of BMI's effect on PCa risk (OR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.90-1.05), while the impact of BT on PCa remained unchanged when accounting for BMI. Moreover, we identified a significant indirect effect of BMI on PCa risk (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94-0.98).Our study provided genetic evidence that serum BT can mediate the effect of BMI on the risk of PCa, indicating the possible mechanism by which obesity reduces PCa risk.",

This study aimed to explore the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) specific to cell types in sepsis and investigate the role of resistin in the survival of sepsis patients through Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. We used single-cell and bulk transcriptome data to identify cell type-specific DEGs between sepsis and healthy controls. MR analyses were then conducted to investigate the causal relationships between resistin (one of the identified DEGs) levels and the survival of sepsis patients. Additionally, we utilized meQTL (methylation quantitative trait loci) to identify cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites that may directly affect sepsis. We identified 560 cell type-specific DEGs between sepsis and healthy controls. Notably, we observed the upregulation of resistin levels in macrophages during sepsis. In bulk transcriptome, RETN is also upregulated in sepsis samples compared with healthy controls. MR analyses revealed a negative association existed between the expression of resistin, at both gene and protein levels, and the mortality or severity of sepsis patients in ICU. Moreover, there were no associations observed between resistin levels and death or organ failure due to other causes. We also identified three methylation CpG sites, located in RETN or its promoter region-cg06633066, cg22322184, and cg02346997-that directly affected both resistin protein levels and sepsis death in the ICU. Our findings suggest that resistin may provide feasible protection for sepsis patients, particularly those with severe cases, without serious side effects. Therefore, resistin could be a potential drug candidate for sepsis treatment. Additionally, we identified two CpG sites, cg06633066 and cg22322184, that were associated with RETN protein levels and sepsis death, providing novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of sepsis.",

However, the causal relationship between plasma PCSK9 and Lp(a) levels remains uncertain. In this study, we explored the association between PCSK9 E670G polymorphism and Lp(a) levels in 614 healthy Taiwanese individuals. Employing a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using openly accessible PCSK9 and Lp(a) summary statistics from the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and UK Biobank, we aimed to determine if a causal link exists between plasma PCSK9 levels and Lp(a) concentrations. Our findings reveal that the E670G G allele is independently associated with a decreased likelihood of developing elevated Lp(a) levels. This association persists even after adjusting for common cardiovascular risk factors and irrespective of lipid profile variations. The MR analysis, utilizing six PCSK9 GWAS-associated variants as instrumental variables to predict plasma PCSK9 levels, provides compelling evidence of a causal relationship between plasma PCSK9 levels and Lp(a) concentration. In conclusion, our study not only replicates the association between the PCSK9 E670G polymorphism and Lp(a) levels but also confirms a causative relationship between PCSK9 levels and Lp(a) concentrations through MR analysis.",

Serum lipids have been found to affect platelet formation and activity in certain diseases, thus inducing the corresponding variation of platelet indices.Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed based on databases. The clinical data from 457 ITP patients were retrospectively collected and analyzed, including platelet indices, serum lipids, hemorrhages and therapeutic responses.MR analysis showed low high-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low apolipoprotein A-1, high triglyceride (TG) and high apolipoprotein B (ApoB) caused high platelet distribution width (PDW); high low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) increased mean platelet volume (MPV). In ITP, there were positive correlations between platelet count with TG, PDW with HDL-C and ApoB, and plateletcrit with TG and non-esterified fatty acid, and the correlation had gender differences. Bleeding scores were negatively correlated with cholesterol and LDL-C. LDL-C and homocysteine were risk factors for therapeutic responses.Serum lipids, especially cholesterol were tightly correlated with platelet indices, hemorrhage and therapeutic effects in ITP patients. These results provide clinical references for the management of serum lipids, and highlight the necessity to further explore the relationship between lipids and pathogenesis of ITP.No: NCT05095896, October 14, 2021, retrospectively registered.© 2023.

         "Fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP-4) is a lipid-binding adipokine upregulated in obesity, which may facilitate fatty acid supply for tumor growth and promote insulin resistance and inflammation and may thus play a role in colorectal cancer (CRC) development. We aimed to investigate the association between circulating FABP-4 and CRC and to assess potential causality using a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach.The association between pre-diagnostic plasma measurements of FABP-4 and CRC risk was investigated in a nested case-control study in 1324 CRC cases and the same number of matched controls within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. A two-sample Mendelian randomization study was conducted based on three genetic variants (1 cis, 2 trans) associated with circulating FABP-4 identified in a published genome-wide association study (discovery n = 20,436) and data from 58,131 CRC cases and 67,347 controls in the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium, Colorectal Cancer Transdisciplinary Study, and Colon Cancer Family Registry.In conditional logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders including body size, the estimated relative risk, RR (95% confidence interval, CI) per one standard deviation, SD (8.9 ng/mL) higher FABP-4 concentration was 1.01 (0.92, 1.12) overall, 0.95 (0.80, 1.13) in men and 1.09 (0.95, 1.25) in women. Genetically determined higher FABP-4 was not associated with colorectal cancer risk (RR per FABP-4 SD was 1.10 (0.95, 1.27) overall, 1.03 (0.84, 1.26) in men and 1.21 (0.98, 1.48) in women). However, in a cis-MR approach, a statistically significant association was observed in women (RR 1.56, 1.09, 2.23) but not overall (RR 1.23, 0.97, 1.57) or in men (0.99, 0.71, 1.37).Taken together, these analyses provide no support for a causal role of circulating FABP-4 in the development of CRC, although the cis-MR provides some evidence for a positive association in women, which may deserve to be investigated further.© 2023.

         "While numerous studies have highlighted an increased prevalence of depression in individuals with narcolepsy, their conclusions are often clouded by potential confounding factors, leaving the causal relationship uncertain. This study posits that narcolepsy might heighten the risk of depression and employs a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate this hypothesis.Summary statistics were obtained from genome-wide association studies databases and performed a two-sample MR analysis. The inverse-variance weighted method was employed as the primary approach to evaluate causality. Additionally, supplementary methods were conducted, including MR-Egger, simple median, maximum likelihood, weighted median, penalized weighted median, and weighted mode, to complement the IVW results. Finally, sensitivity analyses were undertaken to assess heterogeneity, horizontal pleiotropy, and stability of the results.The inverse-variance weighted analysis revealed an odds ratio of 1.055 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.015 to 1.097, indicating a significant positive association between narcolepsy and depression. Although significant heterogeneity was observed (Q = 56.22, p = 0.0005), no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy was detected (intercept = -0.00027, p = 0.69). Results from the additional methods were in agreement with those obtained from the inverse-variance weighted analysis. The reverse causality of depression on narcolepsy was not detected (p = 0.11).This study suggests a potential causal association between narcolepsy and depression. While the findings offer insights into this relationship, they should be interpreted with caution, especially considering the limitations of the data. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and to explore potential interventions.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

         "Observational studies have demonstrated a correlation between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and osteoporosis (OP). However, it is unclear whether there is genetic causality between COPD and bone mineral density (BMD) reduction at different sites. This study assessed the causal relationship between COPD and BMD in various anatomical locations. Data associated with COPD and BMD were obtained from published genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were strongly associated with COPD and BMD could serve as instrumental variables for the analysis. Inverse variance weighted, MR-Egger and weighted median were manipulated to evaluate causality. Subsequently, we conducted heterogeneity tests using Cochran Q test and tested for pleiotropy using the MR-Egger intercept. We performed leave-one-out sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the results. Additionally, we obtained more accurate causal genetic associations by removing any pleiotropic outlying SNPs and performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis with the remaining data. Our findings established that COPD was negatively associated with Heel-BMD (odds ratio[OR] = 0.978, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.966, 0.990, P = .0003) but not LS-BMD (OR = 0.981, 95% CI: 0.943, 1.020, P = .335), FA-BMD (OR = 0.984, 95% CI: 0.927, 1.046, P = .616), and FN-BMD (OR = 0.981, 95% CI: 0.950, 1.014, P = .249). In reverse MR analysis, the results showed no significant causal effect of BMD at different sites on COPD. The results were proved to be dependable and steady by sensitivity, heterogeneity, and pleiotropy analysis. We found that COPD increases the risk of decreased heel BMD, however, there is no evidence that the loss of BMD increases the risk of COPD.Copyright © 2023 the Author(s).

We assessed the overall effect of each life course adiposity factor via inverse-variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, and MR-Egger methods and performed extensive sensitivity analyses. Additionally, multivariable MR was conducted to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of childhood BMI on TMDs while accounting for BW and adult BMI, and vice versa.Univariable MR analyses revealed a causal effect of low childhood adiposity on an increased risk of TMDs (childhood BMI: IVW OR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.54-0.78, p < .001; childhood body size: IVW OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.43-0.73, p < .001). No causal association existed between genetically predicted BW, adult BMI, or body fat percentage and TMDs. In the multivariable MR analyses, the effects of childhood BMI on TMDs occurrence remained significant and direct, even after adjusting for BW and adult BMI (multivariable IVW OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.61-0.99, p = .048). No pleiotropy and heterogeneity were detected (p > .05).Low childhood BMI might causally increase the risk of TMDs through a direct pathway.© 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

Inverse variance weighted, weighted model, MR-Egger regression, and weighted median were adapted to assess the causal relationship between gut microbiota and various types of lung cancer. Sensitivity analysis was used to test for the presence of pleiotropy and heterogeneity in instrumental variables. A reverse MR analysis was performed on these bacteria to determine their potential role in causing lung cancer. A reverse MR analysis was performed on these bacteria to determine their potential role in causing lung cancer. Multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) was conducted to assess the direct causal impact of gut microbiota on the risk of various types of lung cancer.Using IVW as the primary analytical method, we identified a total of 40 groups of gut microbiota with potential causal associations with various subtypes of lung cancer, of which 10 were associated with lung cancer, 10 with lung adenocarcinoma, 9 with squamous cell lung cancer, and 11 groups of bacteria associated with small cell lung cancer. After performing FDR correction, we further found that there was still a significant causal relationship between Peptococcaceae and lung adenocarcinoma. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of these results, with no heterogeneity or pleiotropy found.Our results confirm a causal relationship between specific gut microbiota and lung cancer, providing new insights into the role of gut microbiota in mediating the development of lung cancer.Copyright © 2023 Li, Wang, Zhang, Yang, Wu and Zhao.",

         "Recent studies have shown that an imbalance in gut microbiota (GM) may not always be associated with endometriosis (EMS). To investigate this further, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.MR analysis was performed on genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of GM and EMS. Specifically, the MiBioGen microbiota GWAS (N = 18,340) was used as exposure. The FinnGen study GWAS (8,288 EMS cases and 68,969 controls) was used as outcome. We primarily used the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method to analyze the correlation and conducted a sensitivity analysis to verify its reliability.(1) MR analysis: The results of the IVW method confirmed that a total of 8 GM taxa were related to the risk of EMS. Class-Melainabacteria (p = 0.036), family-Ruminococcaceae (p = 0.037), and genus-Eubacteriumruminantium (p = 0.015) had a protective effect on EMS, whereas order-Bacillales (p = 0.046), family-Prevotellaceae (p = 0.027), genus-Anaerotruncus (p = 0.025), genus-Olsenella (p = 0.036) and genus-RuminococcaceaeUCG002 (p = 0.035) could increase the risk of EMS. (2) Sensitivity analysis: Cochrane's Q test (p > 0.05), MR-Egger intercept method (p > 0.05), and leave-one-out method confirmed the robustness of MR results.This study performed a MR analysis on two large national databases and identified the association between 8 GM taxa and EMS. These taxa could potentially be utilized for indirectly diagnosing EMS and could lead to novel perspectives in research regarding the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of EMS.Copyright © 2023 Ji, Yang, Zhu, Xu, Guo, Rong and Cai.",

         "Observational studies have shown that gut microbiota is closely associated with inflammatory dermatoses such as psoriasis, rosacea, and atopic dermatitis (AD). However, the causal relationship between gut microbiota and inflammatory dermatosis remains unclear.Based on Maximum Likelihood (ML), MR-Egger regression, Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW), MR Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO), Weighted Mode, and Weighted Median Estimator (WME) methods, we performed a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to explore the causal relationship between gut microbiota and inflammatory dermatosis. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data of gut microbiota came from the MiBioGen consortium, while the GWAS summary data of inflammatory dermatosis (including psoriasis, AD, rosacea, vitiligo, acne, and eczema) came from the FinnGen consortium and IEU Open GWAS project. Cochran's IVW Q test tested the heterogeneity among instrumental variables (IVs). The horizontal pleiotropy was tested by MR-Egger regression intercept analysis and MR-PRESSO analysis.Eventually, the results indicated that 5, 16, 17, 11, 15, and 12 gut microbiota had significant causal effects on psoriasis, rosacea, AD, vitiligo, acne, and eczema, respectively, including 42 protective and 34 risk causal relationships. Especially, Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria at the Family and Genus Level, as common probiotics, were identified as protective factors for the corresponding inflammatory dermatoses. The results of reverse MR analysis suggested a bidirectional causal effect between AD and genus Eubacterium brachy group, vitiligo and genus Ruminococcaceae UCG004. The causal relationship between gut microbiota and psoriasis, rosacea, acne, and eczema is unidirectional. There was no significant heterogeneity among these IVs. In conclusion, this bidirectional two-sample MR study identified 76 causal relationships between the gut microbiome and six inflammatory dermatoses, which may be helpful for the clinical prevention and treatment of inflammatory dermatoses.Copyright © 2023 Mao, Yu and Li.",

         "Existing epidemiological observational studies have suggested interesting but inconsistent clinical correlations between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), and kidney stone disease (KSD). Herein, we implemented a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal relationship between IBD and KSD.Data on IBD and KSD were obtained from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) summary statistics and the FinnGen consortium, respectively. Strict selection steps were used to screen for eligible instrumental SNPs. We applied inverse variance weighting (IVW) with the fix-effects model as the major method. Several sensitivity analyses were used to evaluate pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Causal relationships between IBD and KSD were explored in two opposite directions. Furthermore, we carried out multivariable MR (MVMR) to obtain the direct causal effects of IBD on KSD.Our results demonstrated that CD could increase the risk of KSD (IVW: OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.03-1.10, p < 0.001). Similar results were found in the validation group (IVW: OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.01-1.08, p = 0.013) and in the MVMR analysis. Meanwhile, no evidence of a causal association between UC and KSD was identified. The reverse MR analysis detected no causal association.This MR study verified that CD plays a critical role in developing kidney stones and that the effect of UC on KSD needs to be further explored.© 2023.

         "This study used a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to investigate the causal relationship between genetically predicted endometriosis (EMS) and breast cancer risk. A total of 122,977 cases and 105,974 controls were included in the analysis, with gene-level summary data obtained from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). An inverse variance-weighting approach was applied to assess the causal relationship between EMS and breast cancer risk, and weighted median and MR-Egger regression methods were used to evaluate pleiotropy. Results showed a causal relationship between EMS and a decreased risk of overall breast cancer (odds ratio [OR] 0.95; 95% CI 0.90-0.99, p = 0.02). Furthermore, EMS was associated with a lower risk for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer in a subgroup analysis based on immunohistochemistry type (OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.86-0.97, p = 0.005). However, there was no causal association between ER-negative breast cancer and survival (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.94-1.06, p = 0.89). Pleiotropy was not observed. These findings provide evidence of a relationship between EMS and reduced breast cancer risk in invasive breast cancer overall and specific tissue types, and support the results of a previous observational study. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this association.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited.",

         "Current observational studies indicate progressive brain atrophy is closely associated with the clinical feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, it is unclear whether the changes in cortical structure are the cause or result of ALS. Our study aimed to investigate the causal relationship between cortical structure and ALS risk using a bidirectional two-sample MR study.We collected publicly available genome-wide association studies' summary statistics for cortical structure from UK Biobank and ENIGMA consortium (n = 33,992) and ALS from the Project MinE (n = 138,086). We used the inverse variance weighted method (IVW) as primary analysis in order to evaluate the causal effects. In addition, the weighted median and MR Egger methods were performed to ensure the robustness and reliability of the IVW results.We found the decreased surface of the paracentral lobule and thickness of the frontal pole and middle temporal lobe were suggestively associated with an increased risk of ALS as well as the increased surface of medial orbitofrontal and middle temporal lobe. In another aspect, the causalities between the susceptibility to ALS and the volume of the transverse temporal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus were negative. Besides, the susceptibility to ALS might also contribute to an increased thickness of the postcentral gyrus and superior parietal gyrus.In this two-sample MR analysis, we observed that multiple cortical brain regions are associated with a higher ALS risk. Further research into the underlying mechanisms is required to back up our findings.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

         "Observational studies have shown that obesity is a risk factor for various autoimmune diseases. However, the causal relationship between obesity and autoimmune diseases is unclear. Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to investigate the causal effects of obesity on 15 autoimmune diseases.MR analysis employed instrumental variables, specifically single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with obesity measures such as body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, hip circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio. The study utilized UK Biobank and FinnGen data to estimate the causal relationship between obesity and autoimmune diseases.Genetically predicted BMI was associated with risk for five autoimmune diseases. The odds ratio per 1-SD increase in genetically predicted BMI, the OR was 1.28 (95% CI, 1.18-1.09; p &lt; 0.001) for asthma, 1.37 (95% CI, 1.24-1.51; p &lt; 0.001) for hypothyroidism, 1.52 (95% CI, 1.27-1.83; p &lt; 0.001) for psoriasis, 1.22 (95% CI, 1.06-1.40; p = 0.005) for rheumatoid arthritis, and 1.55 (95% CI, 1.32-1.83; p &lt; 0.001) for type 1 diabetes. However, after adjusting for genetic susceptibility to drinking and smoking, the correlation between BMI and rheumatoid arthritis was not statistically significant. Genetically predicted waist circumference, hip circumference, and waist and hip circumference were associated with 6, 6, and 1 autoimmune disease, respectively.This study suggests that obesity may be associated with an increased risk of several autoimmune diseases, such as asthma, hypothyroidism, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and type 1 diabetes.© 2023 The Author(s).

         "When specific nutrients are inadequate, vulnerability to cardiovascular and metabolic illnesses increases. The data linking dietary nutrition with these illnesses, however, has been sparse in the past observational research and randomized controlled trials.A Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to assess the influence of macronutrients (fat, protein, sugar, and carbohydrates) and micronutrients (β-carotene, folate, calcium, iron, copper, magnesium, phosphorus, selenium, zinc, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin B, and vitamin B12) on the susceptibility to cardiovascular metabolic disorders, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, ischemic stroke, and type 2 diabetes.We employed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, utilizing inverse variance weighting and conducting comprehensive sensitivity assessments. We obtained publicly accessible summary data from separate cohorts comprising individuals of European ancestry. The level of statistical significance was established at a threshold of P < 0. 00074.Based on our research findings, we have established a causal association between the consumption of circulating fat and the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The study found that an increase of one standard deviation in fat consumption was associated with a decreased risk of heart failure, with an odds ratio of 0. 56 (95 % CI: 0. 40-0. 79; p = 0. 0007). Notably, various sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of this association. Conversely, we did not find any significant correlation between other dietary components and the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders.Our research findings demonstrate a conspicuous impact of dietary fat consumption on the susceptibility to heart failure, independent of coronary artery disease, diabetes, and stroke. Consequently, it is indicated that dietary factors are unrelated to the predisposition to cardiovascular metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc.",

         "Unsaturated fatty acids have been reported to be associated with the risk of psoriasis. However, the causal relationship between them remains unclear This study aimed to explore the causal relationship between unsaturated FAs and psoriasis. Firstly, we obtained genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for psoriasis from the FINNGEN database (number of cases = 4510, number of controls = 212,242) and different FA levels (number of samples = 114,999) from the IEU OpenGWAS Project. Secondly, the genetic correlation coefficient was calculated using linkage disequilibrium fractional regression. Thirdly, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed using independent instrumental variables (p < 5 × 10-8) to determine the direction of randomization. Finally, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)-related analyses of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were carried out to explore the potential molecular mechanisms of unsaturated FAs affecting psoriasis. We found that an increase in the ratio of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) to total fatty acids could increase the risk of psoriasis (inverse-variance weighted [IVW], adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.175; adjusted 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.045-1.321; adjusted p = .007). However, an increase in the ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAa) to total fatty acids could decrease the risk of psoriasis (IVW, adjusted OR = 0.754; adjusted 95% CI = 0.631-0.901; adjusted p = .002). Moreover, an increase in the ratio of PUFAs to MUFAs could decrease the risk of psoriasis (IVW, adjusted OR = 0.823; adjusted 95% CI = 0.715-0.948; adjusted p = .007). The heterogeneity of data was eliminated, and pleiotropy was not detected. There was no statistical difference in the MR analysis of other fatty acids indices with psoriasis. Further, no statistically significant evidence was found to verify a causal relationship between psoriasis and fatty acid levels in reverse MR. Functional enrichment analysis showed that these eQTL related to common SNPs were mainly involved in organic ion transport, choline metabolism, and the expression of key metabolic factors mediated by PKA, ChREBP, and PP2A. Our study indicated that the ratio of MUFAs to total fatty acids had a positive causal effect on psoriasis, while the ratio of PUFAs to total fatty acids and the ratio of PUFAs to MUFAs had a negative causal effect on psoriasis. Moreover, PKA-, PP2A-, and ChREBP-mediated activation of metabolic factors may play an important role in this process.© 2023 The Authors.

         "The relationship between gut microbiota and the occurrence of cholecystitis remains unclear. Existing research lacks a clear understanding of how circulating vitamin levels modulate this relationship. Therefore, our study aims to investigate whether circulating vitamin levels mediate the causal relationship between gut microbiota and cholecystitis using a two-step bidirectional Mendelian randomization approach.In this study, we initially employed Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSC) analysis to assess the genetic correlation of five circulating vitamin level genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary datasets, thereby avoiding potential sample overlap. Subsequently, we conducted a two-step analysis to investigate the causal effects between gut microbiota and cholecystitis. In the second step, we explored the causal relationship between circulating vitamin levels and cholecystitis and identified the mediating role of vitamin D. The primary method used for causal analysis was the inverse variance-weighted approach. We performed additional sensitivity analyses to ensure result robustness, including the cML-MA method and reverse Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.An increment of one standard deviation in RuminococcaceaeUCG003 was associated with a 25% increased risk of cholecystitis (OR = 1.25, 95%CI = 1.01-1.54, p = 0.04), along with a 3% decrease in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (OR = 0.97, 95%CI = 0.944-0.998, p = 0.04). However, following the rigorous Bonferroni correction, every one standard deviation decrease in circulating vitamin D levels was associated with a 33% increased risk of cholecystitis (OR = 0.67, 95%CI = 0.49-0.90, p = 0.008, Padjust = 0.04). Thus, the potential link between gut microbiota and cholecystitis risk might be mediated by circulating vitamin D levels (proportion mediated = 5.5%). Sensitivity analyses provided no evidence of pleiotropy.Our study results suggest that an elevated abundance of specific gut microbiota is associated with an increased susceptibility to cholecystitis, with the causal relationship being mediated by circulating vitamin D levels. Further large-scale randomized controlled trials are necessary to validate the causal effects of gut microbiota on cholecystitis risk. This study provides novel insights into cholecystitis prevention through the regulation of gut microbiota.Copyright © 2023 Miao, Xiao, Xu, Huang, Liu and Chen.",

         "In recent decades, the decline of male sperm quality has become a worldwide phenomenon, with sperm quality of critical importance for the ability to conceive naturally. Recent studies suggest that male fertility function is closely linked to the gut microbiota, however, the cause-and-effect association between the gut microbiota and male infertility risk is currently unclear.We performed one two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study, which uses summary data on human gut microbiota from the MiBioGen consortium as factors of exposure. FinnGen Consortium R8 data was used to obtain GWAS data for male infertility. To evaluate cause-and-effect associations linking gut microbiota and male infertility risk with multiple Mendelian randomization methods, we included inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, and Maximum Likelihood (ML) Ratio. The heterogeneity of instrumental variables was evaluated through Cochran's Q, Rucker's Q, and leave-one-out analysis methods.We found a positive association between Allisonella, Anaerotruncus, Barnesiella, Intestinibacter, and Lactococcus with male infertility risk according to the MR analysis results. Bacteroides Romboutsia, Ruminococcaceae (NK4A2140group), and Ruminococcaceae (UCG011) play a protective function in male infertility pathogenesis.It was found that gut microbiota and infertility are causally related in this study. In subsequent studies, there is a need to build a larger and more comprehensive GWAS database on male infertility, which will reveal the underlying mechanisms for gut microbiota and male infertility. There is a need for randomized controlled trials for validating the protective effect of the associated gut microbiota against male infertility risk, and for exploring the associated mechanisms.Copyright © 2023 Fu, Wang and Yan.",

         "Numerous observational studies have indicated a link between the composition of gut microbiota and thyroid function. Nevertheless, the precise causal relationship between gut microbiota and thyroid function remains uncertain.In this two-sample Mendelian randomization study, we utilized summary data from a genome-wide association study of gut microbiota composition in 18,340 participants from 24 cohorts, as well as summary statistics on thyroid hormones and thyroid-stimulating hormone from the ThyroidOmics Consortium and summary statistics on hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism from the FinnGen R8 release. Five different methods, including inverse variance weighting, MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode, were employed to examine the causal relationship between gut microbiota and thyroid function. Reverse Mendelian randomization analysis was conducted for taxa identified as having a causal relationship with thyroid function in the Mendelian randomization analysis. To assess the robustness of the results, sensitivity analyses were conducted employing Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, MR-PRESSO global test, and leave-one-out analysis.Through MR analysis of 211 microbial taxa and 4 phenotypes, we identified a total of 34 gut microbiota taxa that were associated with the outcomes. After using the bonferroni method for multiple testing correction, phylum Actinobacteria (id.400) had a protective effect on hypothyroidism (OR=0.883, 95% CI: 0.817-0.955, P=0.002), and class Deltaproteobacteria (id.3087) had a protective effect on hyperthyroidism (OR=0.549, 95% CI: 0.374-0.805, P=0.002). According to the results of reverse MR analysis, no significant causal effect of the four phenotypes was found on gut microbiota. No significant horizontal pleiotropy was detected based on MR-Egger intercept test and MR-PRESSO global test.Through two-sample MR analysis, we identified specific gut microbiota taxa at the genetic level that are predicted to have a causal relationship with thyroid function, which may serve as useful biomarkers for early disease diagnosis.Copyright © 2023 Xie, Zhao and Chen.",

         "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified host genetic variants associated with paratuberculosis (PTB) susceptibility. Most of the GWAS-identified SNPs are in non-coding regions. Connecting these non-coding variants and downstream affected genes is a challenge and, up to date, only a few functional mutations or expression quantitative loci (cis-eQTLs) associated with PTB susceptibility have been identified. In the current study, the associations between imputed whole-genome sequence genotypes and whole RNA-Sequencing data from peripheral blood (PB) and ileocecal valve (ICV) samples of Spanish Holstein cows (N = 16) were analyzed with TensorQTL. This approach allowed the identification of 88 and 37 cis-eQTLs regulating the expression levels of 90 and 37 genes in PB and ICV samples, respectively (False discorey rate, FDR ≤ 0.05). Next, we applied summary-based data Mendelian randomization (SMR) to integrate the cis-eQTL dataset with GWAS data obtained from a cohort of 813 culled cattle that were classified according to the presence or absence of PTB-associated histopathological lesions in gut tissues. After multiple testing corrections (FDR ≤ 0.05), we identified two novel cis-eQTLs affecting the expression of the early growth response factor 4 (EGR4) and the bovine neuroblastoma breakpoint family member 6-like protein isoform 2 (MGC134040) that showed pleiotropic associations with the presence of multifocal and diffuse lesions in gut tissues; P = 0.002 and P = 0.017, respectively. While EGR4 acts as a brake on T-cell proliferation and cytokine production through interaction with the nuclear factor Kappa β (NF-κß), MGC134040 is a target gene of NF-κß. Our findings provide a better understanding of the genetic factors influencing PTB outcomes, confirm that the multifocal lesions are localized/confined lesions that have different underlying host genetics than the diffuse lesions, and highlight regulatory SNPs and regulated-gene targets to design future functional studies.© 2023.

         "Immune-related diseases can interact with each other, and growing evidence suggests that these diseases are associated with allergic rhinitis (AR). However, it is unclear whether previously observed associations reflect causal relationships.This study estimated the genetic association between various immune-related diseases and AR using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR).Eight immune-related diseases were selected as exposure factors, and AR was selected as the outcome. The 8 immune-related disease categories included atopic dermatitis (AD), Graves' disease (GD), asthma, Crohn's disease (CD), multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and ulcerative colitis (UC). Data from GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies) were selected to construct instrumental variables (IVs) for each disease, and multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected as IVs. Corresponding data were retrieved according to the selected SNPs, and all data were summarized and analyzed.A total of 416 SNPs were screened as IVs, and the results of IVW support a causal relationship between AR risk and AD (OR: 1.026, 95% CI: 1.014-1.038, P = 9.59 × 10-6), asthma (OR: 1.057, 95% CI: 1.029-1.086, P = .0001), and CD (OR: 1.006, 95% CI: 1.002-1.011, P = .0085). Furthermore, GD (OR: 0.995, 95% CI: 0.991-0.999, P = .0213) and SLE (OR: 0.997, 95% CI: 0.995-1.000, P = .025) may be protective factors.This MR study found that AD, asthma and CD increase the risk of AR in populations of European ancestry, GD and SLE may be protective factors. These results suggest that confounding factors may have influenced associations previously reported in observational studies.",

         "Mendelian randomization has been widely used to assess the causal effect of a heritable exposure variable on an outcome of interest, using genetic variants as instrumental variables. In practice, data on the exposure variable can be incomplete due to high cost of measurement and technical limits of detection. In this paper, we propose a valid and efficient method to handle both unmeasured and undetectable values of the exposure variable in one-sample Mendelian randomization analysis with individual-level data. We estimate the causal effect of the exposure variable on the outcome using maximum likelihood estimation and develop an expectation maximization algorithm for the computation of the estimator. Simulation studies show that the proposed method performs well in making inference on the causal effect. We apply our method to the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, a community-based prospective cohort study, and estimate the causal effect of several metabolites on phenotypes of interest.Published by Elsevier Inc.",

         "The available evidence regarding the association of antioxidants, minerals, and vitamins with the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) traits is currently limited and inconsistent. Therefore, the purpose of this Mendelian randomization (MR) study was to investigate the potential causal relationship between genetically predicted antioxidants, minerals, and vitamins, and MetS.In this study, we utilized genetic variation as instrumental variable (IV) to capture exposure data related to commonly consumed dietary nutrients, including antioxidants (β-carotene, lycopene, and uric acid), minerals (copper, calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, and selenium), and vitamins (folate, vitamin A, B6, B12, C, D, E, and K1). The outcomes of interest, namely MetS (n = 291,107), waist circumference (n = 462,166), hypertension (n = 463,010), fasting blood glucose (FBG) (n = 281,416), triglycerides (n = 441,016), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (n = 403,943), were assessed using pooled data obtained from the most comprehensive genome-wide association study (GWAS) available. Finally, we applied the inverse variance weighting method as the result and conducted a sensitivity analysis for further validation.Genetically predicted higher iron (OR = 1.070, 95% CI 1.037-1.105, P = 2.91E-05) and magnesium levels (OR = 1.130, 95% CI 1.058-1.208, P = 2.80E-04) were positively associated with increased risk of MetS. For each component of MetS, higher level of genetically predicted selenium (OR = 0.971, 95% CI 0.957-0.986, P = 1.09E-04) was negatively correlated with HDL-C levels, while vitamin K1 (OR = 1.023, 95% CI 1.012-1.033, P = 2.90E-05) was positively correlated with HDL-C levels. Moreover, genetically predicted vitamin D (OR = 0.985, 95% CI 0.978-0.992, P = 5.51E-5) had a protective effect on FBG levels. Genetically predicted iron level (OR = 1.043, 95% CI 1.022-1.064, P = 4.33E-05) had a risk effect on TG level.Our study provides evidence that genetically predicted some specific, but not all, antioxidants, minerals, and vitamins may be causally related to the development of MetS traits.© 2023.

We aimed to systematically estimate the causal relationship between IBD and extracolonic cancers.Independent genetic variants strongly associated with IBD were extracted as instrumental variables from genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted by the International IBD Genetics Consortium including 12,882 IBD patients, 5956 Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and 6968 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Three sources of cancer GWAS were selected as outcome data. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to assess the causal effects of IBD on 32 extracolonic cancers. The meta-analysis was applied to assess the combined causal effect with multiple MR results.IBD, CD, and UC have potential causal associations with oral cavity cancer (IBD: OR = 1.180, 95% CI: 1.059 to 1.316, P = 0.003; CD: OR = 1.112, 95% CI: 1.008 to 1.227, P = 0.034; UC: OR = 1.158, 95% CI: 1.041 to 1.288, P = 0.007). Meta-analysis showed a significant positive causal relationship between IBD and breast cancer (OR = 1.059; 95% CI: 1.033 to 1.086; P < 0.0001) as well as a potential causal relationship between CD and breast cancer (OR = 1.029; 95% CI: 1.002 to 1.055; P = 0.032) based on combining multiple MR results.This comprehensive MR analysis suggested that genetically predicted IBD, as well as its subtypes, may be a risk factor in the development of oral cavity and breast cancer.© 2023.

         "Several observational studies have reported an association between obesity and primary liver cancer (PLC), while the causality behind this association and the comparison of the risk effects of different obesity indicators on PLC remain unclear. In this study, we performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to assess the associations of genetically determined liver fat, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and body mass index (BMI) with the risk of PLC. The summary statistics of exposures were obtained from two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) based on the UK Biobank (UKB) imaging cohort and the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort. GWAS summary statistics for PLC were obtained from FinnGen consortium R7 release data, including 304 PLC cases and 218 488 controls. Inverse-variance weighted (IVW) was used as the primary analysis, and a series of sensitivity analyses were performed to further verify the robustness of these findings. IVW analysis highlighted a significant association of genetically determined liver fat (OR per SD increase: 7.14; 95% CI: 5.10-9.99; P = 2.35E-30) and VAT (OR per SD increase: 5.70; 95% CI: 1.32-24.72; P = .020) with PLC but not of BMI with PLC. The findings were further confirmed by a series of MR methods. No evidence of horizontal pleiotropy between these associations existed. Our study suggested that genetically determined liver fat and VAT rather than BMI were associated with an increased risk of PLC, which suggested that visceral fat distribution is more predictive of the clinical risk of PLC than common in vitro measures.© 2023 The Authors.

         "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex condition resulting from environmental, microbial, immunologic, and genetic factors. With the advancement of Mendelian randomization research in IBD, we have gained new insights into the relationship between these factors and IBD. Many animal models of IBD have been developed using different methods, but few studies have attempted to model IBD by combining environmental factors and microbial factors. In this review, we examine how environmental factors and microbial factors affect the development and progression of IBD, and how they interact with each other and with the intestinal microbiota. We also summarize the current methods for creating animal models of IBD and compare their advantages and disadvantages. Based on the latest findings from Mendelian randomization studies on the role of environmental factors in IBD, we discuss which environmental and microbial factors could be used to construct a more realistic and reliable IBD experimental model. We propose that animal models of IBD should consider both environmental and microbial factors to better mimic human IBD pathogenesis and to reveal the underlying mechanisms of IBD at the immune and genetic levels. We highlight the importance of environmental and microbial factors in IBD pathogenesis and offer new perspectives and suggestions for improving experimental animal modeling. Our goal is to create a model that closely resembles the clinical picture of IBD.",

         "This study aims to investigate the potential bidirectional causal relationship between myopia and vitreous disorders from a genetic perspective, as vitreous disorders have been found to be closely associated with myopia development.To achieve this, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) design was employed. The study utilized pooled statistics from independent genome-wide association studies. Myopia was chosen as the exposure factor, while five different vitreous disorders were considered as outcomes. The primary analytical method was the inverse variance weighting (IVW) method, supplemented by sensitivity analysis.The study yielded significant findings indicating a positive association between myopia and vitreous disorders. The genetic prediction of myopia consistently demonstrated a positive correlation with vitreous disorders, as evidenced by IVW (odds ratio [OR] = 18.387; P < 0.01), MR Egger (OR = 2784.954; P < 0.01), weighted median (OR = 30.284; P < 0.01), and weighted mode (OR = 57.381; P < 0.01). All sensitivity analyses further validated these associations. Furthermore, a significant association was observed between myopia and other unspecified vitreous body disorders (IVW: OR = 57.729; P < 0.01).Studies mainly conducted in European populations have confirmed that myopia, extending beyond early high myopia, plays a crucial role in influencing vitreous disorders and that there is a unidirectional causal relationship between myopia and vitreous disorders. Additionally, a causal relationship was identified between myopia and other unspecified vitreous disordes. These findings introduce fresh perspectives for the clinical management of unspecified vitreous disorders and contribute to the understanding of the effect of myopia on vitreous disorders. Myopia prevention and treatment will aid in slowing down the process of vitreous liquefaction and subsequently decrease the incidence of malignant eye conditions.© 2023.

         "Growing evidence supports an association between physical activity (PA) and the risk of osteoarthritis (OA), but this may be influenced by confounding and reverse causality. Therefore, we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to reveal the causal relationship between PA and OA.MR was performed to explore the causation of PA and OA with genetic variants as instrumental variables. The genetic variants were derived from the summary statistics of a large genome-wide association study meta-analysis based on the European population (n = 661,399), including self-reported leisure screen time (LST) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and Arthritis Research UK Osteoarthritis Genetics Consortium cohorts (417,596, 393,873 and 403,124 for overall, hip and knee OA, respectively). The major MR analysis used in this work was the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach, and sensitivity, pleiotropy, and heterogeneity studies were performed to evaluate the validity of the findings.IVW estimates indicated that LST had a risk effect on overall OA (odds ratio (OR) = 1.309, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.198-1.430, P = 2.330 × 10-9), hip OA (OR = 1.132, 95% CI: 1.009-1.269, P = 0.034) and knee OA (OR = 1.435. 95% CI: 1.286-1.602, P = 1.225 × 10-10). In contrast, no causal relationship was found between MVPA and OA (overall OA: OR = 0.895, 95% CI: 0.664-1.205, P = 0.465; hip OA: OR = 1.189, 95% CI: 0.792-1.786, P = 0.404; knee OA: OR = 0.707, 95% CI: 0.490 -1.021, P = 0.064). In addition, we observed significant heterogeneity in instrumental variables, but no horizontal pleiotropy was detected.Recent findings demonstrated a protective impact of reducing LST on OA, independent of MVPA. This provides valuable insights into the role of physical activity in OA and offers lifestyle recommendations, such as reducing recreational sedentary behaviors and promoting appropriate exercise, for individuals at risk of OA.© 2023.

         "Previous research has already indicated an elevated risk of breast cancer (BC) among survivors of malignant lymphoma, but the underlying reasons remain unknown. Our objective is to elucidate the causal relationship between malignant lymphoma and BC through Mendelian randomization (MR). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data from 181,125 Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients and 181,289 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients from the FinnGen Consortium were utilized as exposure. We selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) strongly associated with the exposure as instrumental variables to investigate their relationship with BC in a cohort of 107,722 participants. Subsequently, we obtained data from the UK Biobank containing gender-stratified information on HL, NHL, and BC. We validated the findings from our analysis and explored the impact of gender. The Inverse-Variance Weighted (IVW) method served as the primary reference for the two-sample MR, accompanied by tests for heterogeneity and pleiotropy.The analysis results from the FinnGen consortium indicate that there is no causal relationship between HL and NHL with BC. HL (OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.98-1.04, p = 0.29), NHL (OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.96-1.05, p = 0.64). When utilizing GWAS data from the UK Biobank that includes different gender cohorts, the lack of association between HL, NHL, and BC remains consistent. HL (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.74-1.56, p = 0.69), HL-Female (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.59-1.19, p = 0.33), NHL (OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.66-1.19, p = 0.44), and NHL-Female (OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.58-1.11, p = 0.18).The two-sample MR analysis indicates that there is no significant causal relationship between malignant lymphoma (HL and NHL) and BC.

         "Iron overload has been associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 severity and mortality in observational studies, but it remains unclear whether these associations represent causal effects. We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to determine associations between genetic liability to iron overload and the risk of COVID-19 severity and mortality. From genome-wide association studies of European ancestry, single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with liver iron (n = 32,858) and ferritin (n = 23,986) were selected as exposure instruments, and summary statistics of the hospitalization (n = 16,551) and mortality (n = 15,815) of COVID-19 were utilized as the outcome. We used the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method as the primary analysis to estimate causal effects, and other alternative approaches as well as comprehensive sensitivity analysis were conducted for estimating the robustness of identified associations. Genetically predicted high liver iron levels were associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality based on the results of IVW analysis (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.05-1.82, P = 0.02). Likewise, sensitivity analyses showed consistent and robust results in general (all P > 0.05). A higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization trend was also observed in patients with high liver iron levels without statistical significance. This study suggests that COVID-19 mortality might be partially driven by the iron accumulation in the liver, supporting the classification of iron overload as one of the independent death risk factors. Therefore, avoiding iron overload and maintaining normal iron levels may be a powerful measure to reduce COVID-19 mortality.© 2023.

         "Exploring the potential association between peripheral blood leukocyte counts and breast cancer risk by Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis methods. Genetic data related to peripheral blood sorting counts of leukocytes were collected from a genome-wide association study by Blood Cell Consortium (BCX). Single nucleotide polymorphic loci predicting peripheral blood sorting counts of these leukocytes were selected as instrumental variables according to the correlation assumption, independence assumption and exclusivity assumption of MR. The data on breast cancer and its subtypes were obtained from Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) and FinnGen Consortium. In this study, the Inverse-Variance Weighted (IVW), Weighted Median, MR-Egger, Maximum Likelihood (ML), MR-PRESSO and Constrained Maximum Likelihood and Model Averaging (cML-MA) methods of random effects models were used for MR analysis. Cochran's Q analysis, and MR-Egger intercept analysis were applied for sensitivity analysis. IVW and cML-MA were considered the primary analytical tools, and the results of the other 4 MRs were used as complementary and validation. The results suggest that there is no significant causal relationship between leukocyte count and breast cancer risk (IVW OR = 0.98 [95% CI: 0.93-1.03], p-value = 0.35; CML-MA OR = 1.01 [95% CI: 0.98-1.05], p-value = 0.51). In addition, we analyzed whether there was a potential correlation between the five main types of categorized leukocyte counts and different breast cancer subtypes.

In this study, we conducted a nested case-control study utilizing a follow-up cohort, resulting in the collection of 47 HDP patients and 30 healthy controls. The GM profiles were explored using 16S rRNA sequencing at three time points during pregnancy. The diversity analysis of GM showed no significant difference between HDP patients and controls, however, we found 21 differential GM during pregnancy. Trend analysis showed that there are statistical differences in the relative abundance of Thermomonas, Xanthomonas, and Phenylobacteriumat during pregnancy in the gestational hypertension group, and of Xanthomonas, Polycyclovorans, and Phenylobacterium in the control group. The correlation study found that six genera of GM are related to blood pressure. Furthermore, the MR analysis identified the causal relationship between Methanobrevibacter and pre-eclampsia (PE). This study first explored the longitudinal change of GM in HDP patients during pregnancy, found the differential GM, and detected the causal association. Our findings may promote the prevention and treatment of HDP from the perspective of GM and provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of HDP.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited.",

We performed bidirectional MR analyses to explore the causal relationships between the GM and stroke, and two mediation analyses, two-step MR and multivariable MR, to discover potential mediating metabolites.Ten taxa were causally associated with stroke, and stroke led to changes in 27 taxa. In the two-step MR, Bifidobacteriales order, Bifidobacteriaceae family, Desulfovibrio genus, apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), phospholipids in high-density lipoprotein (HDL_PL), and the ratio of apolipoprotein B to ApoA1 (ApoB/ApoA1) were causally associated with stroke (all P<0.044). The causal associations between Bifidobacteriales order, Bifidobacteriaceae family and stroke were validated using the weighted median method in an independent cohort. The three GM taxa were all positively associated with ApoA1 and HDL_PL, whereas Desulfovibrio genus was negatively associated with ApoB/ApoA1 (all P<0.010). Additionally, the causal associations between the three GM taxa and ApoA1 remained significant after correcting for the false discovery rate (all q-values <0.027). Multivariable MR showed that the associations between Bifidobacteriales order, Bifidobacteriaceae family and stroke were mediated by ApoA1 and HDL_PL, each accounting for 6.5% (P=0.028) and 4.6% (P=0.033); the association between Desulfovibrio genus and stroke was mediated by ApoA1, HDL_PL, and ApoB/ApoA1, with mediated proportions of 7.6% (P=0.019), 4.2% (P=0.035), and 9.1% (P=0.013), respectively.The current MR study provides evidence supporting the causal relationships between several specific GM taxa and stroke and potential mediating metabolites.",

The genome-wide threshold was 1 × 10-5 in the forward MR analysis and was 5 × 10-8 in the reverse MR analysis. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) was the main method to analyse causality, and MR results were verified by several sensitivity analyses including weighted median, MR Egger, and MR Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier (PRESSO).The IVW method suggested that eight taxa were positively correlated with RA, including: MollicutesRF9 (pIVW <0.01), Alphaproteobacteria (pIVW <0.01), Betaproteobacteria (p IVW =0.04), Bacteroidaceae (pIVW <0.01), Adlercreutzia (pIVW <0.01), Bacteroides (pIVW <0.01), Butyricimonas (p IVW =0.03) and Holdemanella (pIVW =0.03). Six bacterial taxa were negatively correlated with RA, including Desulfovibrionales (pIVW = 0.01), Methanobacteriales (pIVW <0.01), Methanobacteria (PIVW <0.01), Desulfovibrionaceae (pIVW <0.01), Methanobacteriaceae (pIVW <0.01) and Butyrivibrio (pIVW =0.02). Heterogeneity (p>0.05) and pleiotropy (p>0.05) analysis confirmed the robustness of the MR results.We identified some specific bacterial taxa that were causally associated with the risk of RA, providing new insights into prevention and diagnosis of RA.",

However, concordant conclusions have not been attained. In this study, we investigated the relationship between leptin and COPD using an integrative analysis that combined a Mendelian randomization (MR) study with transcriptomic data analysis. Here, the MR analysis was performed on the online platform MR-Base, and the bioinformatics analyses were performed with the aid of R Bioconductor packages. No evidence was found by the integrative analysis to support the association of the two attributes. All methods detected a null causal effect of leptin on COPD in the MR analysis. In particular, when the genetically predicted leptin level increased one unit, the risk of developing COPD was estimated as 0.999 (p = 0.943), 0.920 (p = 0.516), 1.002 (p = 0.885), and 1.002 (p = 0.906) by the Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode method, respectively. Furthermore, no leptin-associated genes except one were identified as being differentially expressed between COPD and control in bioinformatics analysis. The observed association between leptin and COPD in previous observational studies may be attributable to unmeasured confounding effects or reverse causation.",

         "Previous observational studies focused on the association of coffee consumption and neurological disease. However, it is not known whether these associations are causal.We used Mendelian randomization (MR) study to assess the causal relationship of coffee intake with the risk of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, stroke, and migraine. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which had genetic statistical significance with coffee intake were used as instrumental variable (IV). Genetic instruments were stretched from the MRC-IEU (MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit) analysis on the UK Biobank. We performed MR analyses using the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method as the main approach. Sensitivity analyses were further performed using MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO to assess the robustness.In the MR analysis, 40 SNPs were selected as IV, the F statistics for all SNPs ranged from 16 to 359. In IVW approach, our results provide genetic evidence supporting a potential causal association between coffee intake and a lower risk of migraine (OR = 0.528, 95% CI = 0.342-0.817, P = 0.004) and migraine with aura (OR = 0.374, 95% CI = 0.208-0.672, P = 0.001). However, we found no significant association between coffee intake and other neurological diseases along with their subtypes in this MR study.Using genetic data, our MR study found significant evidence supporting a causal association between coffee intake and migraine. This suggests that coffee consumption is likely a trigger or a prevention strategy for migraine.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",

         "Previous studies have observed relationships between immune cells and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but their causal links remain undetermined. Based on the public available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics, we conducted two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to evaluate the associations between 731 immune phenotypes and SLE pairs. Pairwise pleiotropy analysis was performed to identify pleiotropic genes for significant immunophenotype-SLE pairs. A comprehensive gene function analysis was undertaken to explore the mechanisms of immune cells in SLE. By using the instrumental variables extracted from GWAS data, we observed that increased levels of five immune phenotypes were causally associated with SLE risk (FDR < 0.05), that were CD20 on IgD+ CD38- naïve, BAFF-R on IgD+ CD38dim, CD39+ secreting Treg AC, CD14- CD16+ monocyte AC, and HLA DR on CD14+ monocyte. Pairwise gene-based analyses identified a total of 38 pleiotropic genes for 5 significant pairs identified and gene set enrichment analysis revealed the involvement of the identified pleiotropic genes in complex pathways (i.e., systemic lupus erythematosus, an integral component of luminal side of endoplasmic reticulum membrane, C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway and regulation of hormone secretion). This study demonstrates that the immune response influences the progression of SLE in a complex pattern. These findings greatly improve our understanding of the interaction between immune response and SLE risk and also aid in the design of therapeutic strategies from an immunological perspective.© 2023.

         "Based on the findings of current observational studies, asthma and inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) are associated; however, their causal association cannot be established due to methodological limitations.we use two-sample bidirectional mendelian randomization (MR) to overcome the confounding factors and explore the causal link between asthma and inflammatory bowel disease.After selecting asthma and IBD-related genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data and screening single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), MR analysis was performed by four methods: inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, maximum likelihood, and weighted median (WM), while Cochran's Q test was used to detect heterogeneity and MR-Egger intercept to detect horizontal pleiotropy. Finally, we used the leave-one-out method and funnel plot to perform sensitivity analysis.We screened 57, 59, and 60 SNPs in the association analysis of asthma and IBD, CD, and UC, respectively. The results of MR analysis showed that asthma only increased the risk of CD (IVW: OR = 1.1712, 95% CI = 1.0418-1.3167, P value = 0.0082; maximum likelihood: OR = 1.1739, 95% CI = 1.0428-1.3215, P value = 0.0080). Neither forward nor reverse MR analysis revealed heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy. Similarly, we did not find potential directional pleiotropy by funnel plot, and the leave-one-out method did not suggest a significant effect of a single SNP on the overall results.we found a negative correlation between asthma and Crohn's disease, but more research is needed to confirm this.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

         "Previous researches have demonstrated a connection between psychiatric disorders and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), but the cause-and-effect relationship is still unclear. To that goal, the mendelian randomization (MR) method was used to study the causal link between psychiatric disorders and CVDs.Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data were collected for four CVDs, including coronary artery disease (n = 547,261), atrial fibrillation (n = 537,409), heart failure (n = 977,323) and ischemic stroke (n = 440,328). Summary data for four psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder (n = 51,710), major depressive disorder (n = 480,359), schizophrenia (n = 127,906) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (n = 55,374), came from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC). All participants were European. The IVW method was mainly used, and the reliability of the results was increased using sensitivity analyses such as MR-Egger, Cochrane's Q test, MR-PRESSO and leave-one-out.MR revealed that the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was linked to an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (OR, 1.085; 95% CI, 1.021-1.153; P = 0.008), heart failure (OR, 1.117; 95% CI, 1.044-1.195; P = 0.001), and ischemic stroke (OR, 1.146; 95% CI, 1.052-1.248; P = 0.002). The schizophrenia was linked to an increased risk of heart failure (OR, 1.035; 95% CI, 1.006-1.066; P = 0.017), but was found to be suggestively inverse associated with coronary artery disease (OR, 0.969; 95% CI, 0.941-0.997; P = 0.03). The major depressive disorder was associated with higher odds of coronary artery disease (OR, 1.109; 95% CI, 1.018-1.208; P = 0.018), while the bipolar disorder was linked to a reduced incidence of coronary artery disease (OR, 0.894; 95% CI, 0.831-0.961; P = 0.002) and heart failure (OR, 0.889; 95% CI, 0.829-0.955; P = 0.001). There were no clear relationships between other psychiatric disorders and CVDs.The results provide genetic proof of a possible causal relationship between psychiatric disorders and CVDs. These results imply that psychiatric disorders may be the cause of some CVDs, and that some abnormal mental states may increase or reduce the likelihood of CVDs, providing guidance for the CVDs prevention.© 2023 The Authors.",

Different dementia types are collected from the GWAS in the European population. Inverse variance weighting is utilized as the main method, complemented by several sensitivity approaches to verify the robustness of the results.Genetically predicted MetS and its five components are not causally associated with the increasing risk of dementia (all p > 0.05). In addition, no significant association between MetS and its components and Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and dementia due to Parkinson's disease (all p > 0.05), except the association between HDL-C and dementia with Lewy bodies.

The data on chronic elevation of alanine aminotransferase (cALT), a proxy of NAFLD, were derived from Million Veteran Program (68 725 patients and 95 472 controls). Cirrhosis data were collected from two sources: a genome-wide association study of five cohorts (4829 patients and 72 705 controls) and FinnGen (1931 patients and 216 861 controls). Liver cancer data were collected from FinnGen (304 patients and 174 006 controls). For East Asian populations, the data on cirrhosis (2184 patients and 210 269 controls) and hepatocellular carcinoma (1866 patients and 195 745 controls) were obtained from Biobank Japan. Three, 41, seven, six, and three single-nucleotide polymorphisms were used for NAFLD (European), cALT (European), cirrhosis (European-five cohorts), cirrhosis (European-FinnGen), and cirrhosis (East Asian), respectively. We used inverse-variance weighted as the primary method to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Among European populations, genetically-predicted NAFLD, cALT, cirrhosis (five cohorts), and cirrhosis (FinnGen) were positively associated with liver cancer, with ORs (95% CIs) of 6.62 (3.81-11.50) (p < .001), 2.59 (1.70-3.94) (p < .001), 3.38 (2.41-4.75) (p < .001), and 2.62 (1.20-5.72) (p = .015). Among East Asian populations, there was also a positive association between genetically-predicted cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (OR = 2.12; 95% CI = 1.78-2.52; p < .001).This study utilized MR to complementarily confirm the positive connections of NAFLD and cirrhosis with liver cancer, as identified in earlier observational research.

Methods: The genetic data related to OSA were obtained from the FinnGen Biobank (Ncase=16, 761, Ncontrol=201, 194) in the Genome-wide association study (GWAS). Three single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) were screened out as instrumental variable (IV) of OSA. The genetic data related to T2D were derived from a large Meta-analysis of GWAS (Ncase=62, 892, Ncontrol=596, 424), 114 SNP were selected as IV of T2D. Multiple MR methods were used for analysis and inverse variance weighted (IVW) was performed as main method. The sensitivity of MR analytic results was analyzed using MR-Egger and other methods, and the IV was evaluated using F-value statistics. Results: MR analysis showed that OSA was significantly associated with increased risk of T2D (OR=2.016, 95%CI: 1.185-3.429, P<0.05). There was no significant relationship between T2D and OSA risk (OR=1.030, 95%CI: 0.980-1.082, P=0.238). There was heterogeneity in both-way results (OSA➝T2D, P=1.808×10-11; T2D➝OSA, P=1.729×10-7), and no horizontal pleiotropy (OSA➝T2D, P=0.477; T2D➝OSA, P=0.349). IV of OSA and T2D-selected in the study were strong instrumental variables (F statistics of OSA=20.543; F statistics of T2D=30.117). Conclusion: Our results supported that OSA was a risk factor for T2D, but T2D had no significant impact on the incidence of OSA. Blood glucose monitoring and diabetes screening in OSA patients might be beneficial to the early detection and intervention of T2D.",

         "With the development and popularization of low-dose chest CT technology, the diagnosis and survival rates of patients with early lung cancer (LC) have significantly improved. The occurrence of colorectal cancer (CRC) as the second primary cancer (SPC) in primary lung cancer (PLC) survivors has become an essential factor affecting the prognosis of early LC. This study explored the potential association between PLC and CRC genetically, laying a foundation for developing SPC-CRC prevention strategies after primary early LC.Based on a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) design, this study systematically screened genetic instrumental variables (IVs) based on the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of PLC and CRC, applied inverse variance weighted (IVW) as the main method to assess the incidence association between the two cancers, and used a variety of other MR methods for supplementary analysis. Finally, the Genetic Risk Scores (GRS) method was used for secondary analysis to verify the results robustness further.From LC to CRC forward MR analysis, 20 genetic IVs of overall LC, 15 genetic IVs of squamous cell lung carcinoma (LUSC), and 10 genetic IVs of adenocarcinoma of the lung (LUAD) were screened. In the reverse MR analysis from CRC to LC, 47 genetic IVs for overall CRC, 37 for colon cancer, and 25 for rectal cancer were screened. The IVW method and a variety of MR methods all found that overall LC and CRC were significantly associated at the genetic level. Subgroup analysis also showed that LUSC was associated with CRC. And the results of the GRS method were consistent with those of the main analysis, confirming the robustness of the study. Our MR study found an association between LC and CRC, with an increased risk of SPC-CRC following PLC, especially LUSC. Our study provides an essential basis for the precise prevention of SPC-CRC after PLC, suggesting that we should pay more attention to the population with a history of PLC in clinical work, and pay close attention to the incidence of SPC-CRC, and carry out intervention and treatment as soon as possible.© 2023.

The objective of our study is to investigate whether there is a direct causal effect of AF on PE. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach was utilized to determine whether there is a causal relationship between AF and PE. European population-based consortia provided statistical data on the associations between Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and relevant traits. The AF dataset was obtained from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) comprising 60,620 cases and 970,216 controls, while a GWAS of 1846 cases and 461,164 controls identified genetic variations associated with PE. Estimation of the causal effect was mainly performed using the random effects inverse-variance weighted method (IVW). Additionally, other tests such as MR-Egger intercept, MR-PRESSO, Cochran's Q test, \"Leave-one-out,\" and funnel plots were conducted to assess the extent of pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Using 70 SNPs, there was no evidence to suggest an association between genetically predicted AF and risk of PE with multiplicative random-effects IVW MR analysis (odds ratio = 1.0003, 95% confidence interval: 0.9998-1.0008, P = 0.20). A null association was also observed in other methods. MR-Egger regression and MR-PRESSO respectively showed no evidence of directional (intercept, - 2.25; P = 0.94) and horizontal(P-value in the global heterogeneity test = 0.99) pleiotropic effect across the genetic variants. No substantial evidence was found to support the causal role of AF in the development of PE.© 2023.

Pleiotropy, heterogeneity, and sensitivity analyses were performed to verify result reliability. High levels of PUFAs were found to be associated with reduced risk of both ADR and PDR. Moreover, FAw3 was associated with a decreased risk of PDR, whereas FAw6 demonstrated an association with lowered risks of both BDR and PDR. Our findings provide genetic evidence, for the first time, for a causal relationship between PUFAs and reduced DR risk. Consequently, our comprehensive MR analysis strongly urges further investigation into the precise functions and long-term effects of PUFAs, FAw3, and FAw6 on DR.",

The heel bone mineral density is often used as a representative measure of overall bone mineral density. Lipid metabolism, which includes processes such as fatty acid metabolism, glycerol metabolism, inositol metabolism, bile acid metabolism, carnitine metabolism, ketone body metabolism, sterol and steroid metabolism, etc., may have an impact on changes in bone mineral density. While some studies have reported correlations between lipid metabolism and heel bone mineral density, the overall causal relationship between metabolites and heel bone mineral density remains unclear.to investigate the causal relationship between lipid metabolites and heel bone mineral density using two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis.Summary-level data from large-scale genome-wide association studies were extracted to identify genetic variants linked to lipid metabolite levels. These genetic variants were subsequently employed as instrumental variables in Mendelian randomization analysis to estimate the causal effects of each lipid metabolite on heel bone mineral density. Furthermore, metabolites that could potentially be influenced by causal relationships with bone mineral density were extracted from the KEGG and WikiPathways databases. The causal associations between these downstream metabolites and heel bone mineral density were then examined. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the robustness of the results and address potential sources of bias.A total of 130 lipid metabolites were analyzed, and it was found that acetylcarnitine, propionylcarnitine, hexadecanedioate, tetradecanedioate, myo-inositol, 1-arachidonoylglycerophosphorine, 1-linoleoylglycerophoethanolamine, and epiandrosterone sulfate had a causal relationship with heel bone mineral density (p < 0.05). Furthermore, our findings also indicate an absence of causal association between the downstream metabolites associated with the aforementioned metabolites identified in the KEGG and WikiPathways databases and heel bone mineral density.This work supports the hypothesis that lipid metabolites have an impact on bone health through demonstrating a causal relationship between specific lipid metabolites and heel bone mineral density. This study has significant implications for the development of new strategies to osteoporosis prevention and treatment.",

         "This study aimed to investigate whether testosterone mediates or confounds the effect of obesity-related traits on prostate cancer (PCa) using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.Data of obesity-related traits (body mass index [BMI], waist-to-hip ratio [WHR], and waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index [WHRadjBMI]) were obtained from up to 806,834 people of European ancestry; data of testosterone (bioavailable testosterone [BT], total testosterone [TT], and sex hormone-binding globulin [SHBG]) were extracted from up to 194,453 participants in the UK Biobank; and the summary-level data of PCa (79,194 cases and 61,112 controls) were obtained from the PRACTICAL consortium.The results supported the causal relationship between higher BMI and a reduced risk of PCa (OR = 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.86-0.96). Furthermore, increased BT levels were associated with an elevated risk of PCa (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.06-1.24). Importantly, our analysis revealed a unidirectional causal effect-higher BMI was linked to lower BT levels (beta = -0.27, 95% CI: -0.3--0.24), but not the other way around. This suggests that BT may mediate the effect of BMI on PCa rather than confound it. Our multivariable MR results further demonstrated that considering BT as a mediator led to the weakening of BMI's effect on PCa risk (OR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.90-1.05), while the impact of BT on PCa remained unchanged when accounting for BMI. Moreover, we identified a significant indirect effect of BMI on PCa risk (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94-0.98).Our study provided genetic evidence that serum BT can mediate the effect of BMI on the risk of PCa, indicating the possible mechanism by which obesity reduces PCa risk.",

This study aimed to explore the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) specific to cell types in sepsis and investigate the role of resistin in the survival of sepsis patients through Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. We used single-cell and bulk transcriptome data to identify cell type-specific DEGs between sepsis and healthy controls. MR analyses were then conducted to investigate the causal relationships between resistin (one of the identified DEGs) levels and the survival of sepsis patients. Additionally, we utilized meQTL (methylation quantitative trait loci) to identify cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites that may directly affect sepsis. We identified 560 cell type-specific DEGs between sepsis and healthy controls. Notably, we observed the upregulation of resistin levels in macrophages during sepsis. In bulk transcriptome, RETN is also upregulated in sepsis samples compared with healthy controls. MR analyses revealed a negative association existed between the expression of resistin, at both gene and protein levels, and the mortality or severity of sepsis patients in ICU. Moreover, there were no associations observed between resistin levels and death or organ failure due to other causes. We also identified three methylation CpG sites, located in RETN or its promoter region-cg06633066, cg22322184, and cg02346997-that directly affected both resistin protein levels and sepsis death in the ICU. Our findings suggest that resistin may provide feasible protection for sepsis patients, particularly those with severe cases, without serious side effects. Therefore, resistin could be a potential drug candidate for sepsis treatment. Additionally, we identified two CpG sites, cg06633066 and cg22322184, that were associated with RETN protein levels and sepsis death, providing novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of sepsis.",

However, the causal relationship between plasma PCSK9 and Lp(a) levels remains uncertain. In this study, we explored the association between PCSK9 E670G polymorphism and Lp(a) levels in 614 healthy Taiwanese individuals. Employing a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using openly accessible PCSK9 and Lp(a) summary statistics from the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and UK Biobank, we aimed to determine if a causal link exists between plasma PCSK9 levels and Lp(a) concentrations. Our findings reveal that the E670G G allele is independently associated with a decreased likelihood of developing elevated Lp(a) levels. This association persists even after adjusting for common cardiovascular risk factors and irrespective of lipid profile variations. The MR analysis, utilizing six PCSK9 GWAS-associated variants as instrumental variables to predict plasma PCSK9 levels, provides compelling evidence of a causal relationship between plasma PCSK9 levels and Lp(a) concentration. In conclusion, our study not only replicates the association between the PCSK9 E670G polymorphism and Lp(a) levels but also confirms a causative relationship between PCSK9 levels and Lp(a) concentrations through MR analysis.",

The changes in platelet indices depend on the morphology and volume of platelets. Serum lipids have been found to affect platelet formation and activity in certain diseases, thus inducing the corresponding variation of platelet indices.Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed based on databases. The clinical data from 457 ITP patients were retrospectively collected and analyzed, including platelet indices, serum lipids, hemorrhages and therapeutic responses.MR analysis showed low high-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low apolipoprotein A-1, high triglyceride (TG) and high apolipoprotein B (ApoB) caused high platelet distribution width (PDW); high low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) increased mean platelet volume (MPV). In ITP, there were positive correlations between platelet count with TG, PDW with HDL-C and ApoB, and plateletcrit with TG and non-esterified fatty acid, and the correlation had gender differences. Bleeding scores were negatively correlated with cholesterol and LDL-C. LDL-C and homocysteine were risk factors for therapeutic responses.Serum lipids, especially cholesterol were tightly correlated with platelet indices, hemorrhage and therapeutic effects in ITP patients.

We aimed to investigate the association between circulating FABP-4 and CRC and to assess potential causality using a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach.The association between pre-diagnostic plasma measurements of FABP-4 and CRC risk was investigated in a nested case-control study in 1324 CRC cases and the same number of matched controls within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. A two-sample Mendelian randomization study was conducted based on three genetic variants (1 cis, 2 trans) associated with circulating FABP-4 identified in a published genome-wide association study (discovery n = 20,436) and data from 58,131 CRC cases and 67,347 controls in the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium, Colorectal Cancer Transdisciplinary Study, and Colon Cancer Family Registry.In conditional logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders including body size, the estimated relative risk, RR (95% confidence interval, CI) per one standard deviation, SD (8.9 ng/mL) higher FABP-4 concentration was 1.01 (0.92, 1.12) overall, 0.95 (0.80, 1.13) in men and 1.09 (0.95, 1.25) in women. Genetically determined higher FABP-4 was not associated with colorectal cancer risk (RR per FABP-4 SD was 1.10 (0.95, 1.27) overall, 1.03 (0.84, 1.26) in men and 1.21 (0.98, 1.48) in women). However, in a cis-MR approach, a statistically significant association was observed in women (RR 1.56, 1.09, 2.23) but not overall (RR 1.23, 0.97, 1.57) or in men (0.99, 0.71, 1.37).Taken together, these analyses provide no support for a causal role of circulating FABP-4 in the development of CRC, although the cis-MR provides some evidence for a positive association in women, which may deserve to be investigated further.© 2023.

This study posits that narcolepsy might heighten the risk of depression and employs a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate this hypothesis.Summary statistics were obtained from genome-wide association studies databases and performed a two-sample MR analysis. The inverse-variance weighted method was employed as the primary approach to evaluate causality. Additionally, supplementary methods were conducted, including MR-Egger, simple median, maximum likelihood, weighted median, penalized weighted median, and weighted mode, to complement the IVW results. Finally, sensitivity analyses were undertaken to assess heterogeneity, horizontal pleiotropy, and stability of the results.The inverse-variance weighted analysis revealed an odds ratio of 1.055 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.015 to 1.097, indicating a significant positive association between narcolepsy and depression. Although significant heterogeneity was observed (Q = 56.22, p = 0.0005), no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy was detected (intercept = -0.00027, p = 0.69). Results from the additional methods were in agreement with those obtained from the inverse-variance weighted analysis. The reverse causality of depression on narcolepsy was not detected (p = 0.11).This study suggests a potential causal association between narcolepsy and depression. While the findings offer insights into this relationship, they should be interpreted with caution, especially considering the limitations of the data. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and to explore potential interventions.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Inverse variance weighted, MR-Egger and weighted median were manipulated to evaluate causality. Subsequently, we conducted heterogeneity tests using Cochran Q test and tested for pleiotropy using the MR-Egger intercept. We performed leave-one-out sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the results. Additionally, we obtained more accurate causal genetic associations by removing any pleiotropic outlying SNPs and performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis with the remaining data. Our findings established that COPD was negatively associated with Heel-BMD (odds ratio[OR] = 0.978, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.966, 0.990, P = .0003) but not LS-BMD (OR = 0.981, 95% CI: 0.943, 1.020, P = .335), FA-BMD (OR = 0.984, 95% CI: 0.927, 1.046, P = .616), and FN-BMD (OR = 0.981, 95% CI: 0.950, 1.014, P = .249). In reverse MR analysis, the results showed no significant causal effect of BMD at different sites on COPD. The results were proved to be dependable and steady by sensitivity, heterogeneity, and pleiotropy analysis. We found that COPD increases the risk of decreased heel BMD, however, there is no evidence that the loss of BMD increases the risk of COPD.Copyright © 2023 the Author(s).

         "Previous studies investigated the associations between obesity and temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), but the evidence for the causal inferences was unclear.We aimed to investigate the causal link between life course adiposity and TMDs.Mendelian randomization (MR) studies were performed using genetic instruments for birth weight (BW) (N = 261 932), childhood body mass index (BMI) (N = 39 620), childhood body size (N = 454 718), adult BMI (N = 99 998), body fat percentage (N = 454 633) and TMDs (N = 211 023). We assessed the overall effect of each life course adiposity factor via inverse-variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, and MR-Egger methods and performed extensive sensitivity analyses. Additionally, multivariable MR was conducted to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of childhood BMI on TMDs while accounting for BW and adult BMI, and vice versa.Univariable MR analyses revealed a causal effect of low childhood adiposity on an increased risk of TMDs (childhood BMI: IVW OR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.54-0.78, p < .001; childhood body size: IVW OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.43-0.73, p < .001). No causal association existed between genetically predicted BW, adult BMI, or body fat percentage and TMDs. In the multivariable MR analyses, the effects of childhood BMI on TMDs occurrence remained significant and direct, even after adjusting for BW and adult BMI (multivariable IVW OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.61-0.99, p = .048). No pleiotropy and heterogeneity were detected (p > .05).Low childhood BMI might causally increase the risk of TMDs through a direct pathway.© 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

However, its causal relationship with various types of lung cancer remains unclear.We conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study using the largest genome-wide association analysis of gut microbiota data to date from the MiBioGen consortium, with pooled statistics for various types of lung cancer from the Transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of the Lung, the International Lung Cancer Consortium, and FinnGen Consortium R7 release data.

A reverse MR analysis was performed on these bacteria to determine their potential role in causing lung cancer. Multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) was conducted to assess the direct causal impact of gut microbiota on the risk of various types of lung cancer.Using IVW as the primary analytical method, we identified a total of 40 groups of gut microbiota with potential causal associations with various subtypes of lung cancer, of which 10 were associated with lung cancer, 10 with lung adenocarcinoma, 9 with squamous cell lung cancer, and 11 groups of bacteria associated with small cell lung cancer. After performing FDR correction, we further found that there was still a significant causal relationship between Peptococcaceae and lung adenocarcinoma. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of these results, with no heterogeneity or pleiotropy found.Our results confirm a causal relationship between specific gut microbiota and lung cancer, providing new insights into the role of gut microbiota in mediating the development of lung cancer.Copyright © 2023 Li, Wang, Zhang, Yang, Wu and Zhao.",

To investigate this further, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.MR analysis was performed on genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of GM and EMS. Specifically, the MiBioGen microbiota GWAS (N = 18,340) was used as exposure. The FinnGen study GWAS (8,288 EMS cases and 68,969 controls) was used as outcome. We primarily used the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method to analyze the correlation and conducted a sensitivity analysis to verify its reliability.(1) MR analysis: The results of the IVW method confirmed that a total of 8 GM taxa were related to the risk of EMS. Class-Melainabacteria (p = 0.036), family-Ruminococcaceae (p = 0.037), and genus-Eubacteriumruminantium (p = 0.015) had a protective effect on EMS, whereas order-Bacillales (p = 0.046), family-Prevotellaceae (p = 0.027), genus-Anaerotruncus (p = 0.025), genus-Olsenella (p = 0.036) and genus-RuminococcaceaeUCG002 (p = 0.035) could increase the risk of EMS. (2) Sensitivity analysis: Cochrane's Q test (p > 0.05), MR-Egger intercept method (p > 0.05), and leave-one-out method confirmed the robustness of MR results.This study performed a MR analysis on two large national databases and identified the association between 8 GM taxa and EMS. These taxa could potentially be utilized for indirectly diagnosing EMS and could lead to novel perspectives in research regarding the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of EMS.Copyright © 2023 Ji, Yang, Zhu, Xu, Guo, Rong and Cai.",

However, the causal relationship between gut microbiota and inflammatory dermatosis remains unclear.Based on Maximum Likelihood (ML), MR-Egger regression, Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW), MR Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO), Weighted Mode, and Weighted Median Estimator (WME) methods, we performed a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to explore the causal relationship between gut microbiota and inflammatory dermatosis. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data of gut microbiota came from the MiBioGen consortium, while the GWAS summary data of inflammatory dermatosis (including psoriasis, AD, rosacea, vitiligo, acne, and eczema) came from the FinnGen consortium and IEU Open GWAS project. Cochran's IVW Q test tested the heterogeneity among instrumental variables (IVs). The horizontal pleiotropy was tested by MR-Egger regression intercept analysis and MR-PRESSO analysis.Eventually, the results indicated that 5, 16, 17, 11, 15, and 12 gut microbiota had significant causal effects on psoriasis, rosacea, AD, vitiligo, acne, and eczema, respectively, including 42 protective and 34 risk causal relationships. Especially, Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria at the Family and Genus Level, as common probiotics, were identified as protective factors for the corresponding inflammatory dermatoses. The results of reverse MR analysis suggested a bidirectional causal effect between AD and genus Eubacterium brachy group, vitiligo and genus Ruminococcaceae UCG004. The causal relationship between gut microbiota and psoriasis, rosacea, acne, and eczema is unidirectional. There was no significant heterogeneity among these IVs. In conclusion, this bidirectional two-sample MR study identified 76 causal relationships between the gut microbiome and six inflammatory dermatoses, which may be helpful for the clinical prevention and treatment of inflammatory dermatoses.Copyright © 2023 Mao, Yu and Li.",

Several sensitivity analyses were used to evaluate pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Causal relationships between IBD and KSD were explored in two opposite directions. Furthermore, we carried out multivariable MR (MVMR) to obtain the direct causal effects of IBD on KSD.Our results demonstrated that CD could increase the risk of KSD (IVW: OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.03-1.10, p < 0.001).

A total of 122,977 cases and 105,974 controls were included in the analysis, with gene-level summary data obtained from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). An inverse variance-weighting approach was applied to assess the causal relationship between EMS and breast cancer risk, and weighted median and MR-Egger regression methods were used to evaluate pleiotropy. Results showed a causal relationship between EMS and a decreased risk of overall breast cancer (odds ratio [OR] 0.95; 95% CI 0.90-0.99, p = 0.02). Furthermore, EMS was associated with a lower risk for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer in a subgroup analysis based on immunohistochemistry type (OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.86-0.97, p = 0.005). However, there was no causal association between ER-negative breast cancer and survival (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.94-1.06, p = 0.89). Pleiotropy was not observed. These findings provide evidence of a relationship between EMS and reduced breast cancer risk in invasive breast cancer overall and specific tissue types, and support the results of a previous observational study.

         "Current observational studies indicate progressive brain atrophy is closely associated with the clinical feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, it is unclear whether the changes in cortical structure are the cause or result of ALS. Our study aimed to investigate the causal relationship between cortical structure and ALS risk using a bidirectional two-sample MR study.We collected publicly available genome-wide association studies' summary statistics for cortical structure from UK Biobank and ENIGMA consortium (n = 33,992) and ALS from the Project MinE (n = 138,086). We used the inverse variance weighted method (IVW) as primary analysis in order to evaluate the causal effects. In addition, the weighted median and MR Egger methods were performed to ensure the robustness and reliability of the IVW results.We found the decreased surface of the paracentral lobule and thickness of the frontal pole and middle temporal lobe were suggestively associated with an increased risk of ALS as well as the increased surface of medial orbitofrontal and middle temporal lobe. In another aspect, the causalities between the susceptibility to ALS and the volume of the transverse temporal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus were negative. Besides, the susceptibility to ALS might also contribute to an increased thickness of the postcentral gyrus and superior parietal gyrus.In this two-sample MR analysis, we observed that multiple cortical brain regions are associated with a higher ALS risk. Further research into the underlying mechanisms is required to back up our findings.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

         "Observational studies have shown that obesity is a risk factor for various autoimmune diseases. However, the causal relationship between obesity and autoimmune diseases is unclear. Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to investigate the causal effects of obesity on 15 autoimmune diseases.MR analysis employed instrumental variables, specifically single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with obesity measures such as body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, hip circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio. The study utilized UK Biobank and FinnGen data to estimate the causal relationship between obesity and autoimmune diseases.Genetically predicted BMI was associated with risk for five autoimmune diseases. The odds ratio per 1-SD increase in genetically predicted BMI, the OR was 1.28 (95% CI, 1.18-1.09; p &lt; 0.001) for asthma, 1.37 (95% CI, 1.24-1.51; p &lt; 0.001) for hypothyroidism, 1.52 (95% CI, 1.27-1.83; p &lt; 0.001) for psoriasis, 1.22 (95% CI, 1.06-1.40; p = 0.005) for rheumatoid arthritis, and 1.55 (95% CI, 1.32-1.83; p &lt; 0.001) for type 1 diabetes. However, after adjusting for genetic susceptibility to drinking and smoking, the correlation between BMI and rheumatoid arthritis was not statistically significant. Genetically predicted waist circumference, hip circumference, and waist and hip circumference were associated with 6, 6, and 1 autoimmune disease, respectively.This study suggests that obesity may be associated with an increased risk of several autoimmune diseases, such as asthma, hypothyroidism, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and type 1 diabetes.© 2023 The Author(s).

         "When specific nutrients are inadequate, vulnerability to cardiovascular and metabolic illnesses increases. The data linking dietary nutrition with these illnesses, however, has been sparse in the past observational research and randomized controlled trials.A Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to assess the influence of macronutrients (fat, protein, sugar, and carbohydrates) and micronutrients (β-carotene, folate, calcium, iron, copper, magnesium, phosphorus, selenium, zinc, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin B, and vitamin B12) on the susceptibility to cardiovascular metabolic disorders, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, ischemic stroke, and type 2 diabetes.We employed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, utilizing inverse variance weighting and conducting comprehensive sensitivity assessments. We obtained publicly accessible summary data from separate cohorts comprising individuals of European ancestry. The level of statistical significance was established at a threshold of P < 0. 00074.Based on our research findings, we have established a causal association between the consumption of circulating fat and the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The study found that an increase of one standard deviation in fat consumption was associated with a decreased risk of heart failure, with an odds ratio of 0. 56 (95 % CI: 0. 40-0. 79; p = 0. 0007). Notably, various sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of this association. Conversely, we did not find any significant correlation between other dietary components and the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders.Our research findings demonstrate a conspicuous impact of dietary fat consumption on the susceptibility to heart failure, independent of coronary artery disease, diabetes, and stroke. Consequently, it is indicated that dietary factors are unrelated to the predisposition to cardiovascular metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc.",

         "Unsaturated fatty acids have been reported to be associated with the risk of psoriasis. However, the causal relationship between them remains unclear This study aimed to explore the causal relationship between unsaturated FAs and psoriasis. Firstly, we obtained genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for psoriasis from the FINNGEN database (number of cases = 4510, number of controls = 212,242) and different FA levels (number of samples = 114,999) from the IEU OpenGWAS Project. Secondly, the genetic correlation coefficient was calculated using linkage disequilibrium fractional regression. Thirdly, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed using independent instrumental variables (p < 5 × 10-8) to determine the direction of randomization. Finally, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)-related analyses of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were carried out to explore the potential molecular mechanisms of unsaturated FAs affecting psoriasis. We found that an increase in the ratio of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) to total fatty acids could increase the risk of psoriasis (inverse-variance weighted [IVW], adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.175; adjusted 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.045-1.321; adjusted p = .007). However, an increase in the ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAa) to total fatty acids could decrease the risk of psoriasis (IVW, adjusted OR = 0.754; adjusted 95% CI = 0.631-0.901; adjusted p = .002). Moreover, an increase in the ratio of PUFAs to MUFAs could decrease the risk of psoriasis (IVW, adjusted OR = 0.823; adjusted 95% CI = 0.715-0.948; adjusted p = .007). The heterogeneity of data was eliminated, and pleiotropy was not detected. There was no statistical difference in the MR analysis of other fatty acids indices with psoriasis. Further, no statistically significant evidence was found to verify a causal relationship between psoriasis and fatty acid levels in reverse MR. Functional enrichment analysis showed that these eQTL related to common SNPs were mainly involved in organic ion transport, choline metabolism, and the expression of key metabolic factors mediated by PKA, ChREBP, and PP2A. Our study indicated that the ratio of MUFAs to total fatty acids had a positive causal effect on psoriasis, while the ratio of PUFAs to total fatty acids and the ratio of PUFAs to MUFAs had a negative causal effect on psoriasis. Moreover, PKA-, PP2A-, and ChREBP-mediated activation of metabolic factors may play an important role in this process.© 2023 The Authors.

         "The relationship between gut microbiota and the occurrence of cholecystitis remains unclear. Existing research lacks a clear understanding of how circulating vitamin levels modulate this relationship. Therefore, our study aims to investigate whether circulating vitamin levels mediate the causal relationship between gut microbiota and cholecystitis using a two-step bidirectional Mendelian randomization approach.In this study, we initially employed Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSC) analysis to assess the genetic correlation of five circulating vitamin level genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary datasets, thereby avoiding potential sample overlap. Subsequently, we conducted a two-step analysis to investigate the causal effects between gut microbiota and cholecystitis. In the second step, we explored the causal relationship between circulating vitamin levels and cholecystitis and identified the mediating role of vitamin D. The primary method used for causal analysis was the inverse variance-weighted approach. We performed additional sensitivity analyses to ensure result robustness, including the cML-MA method and reverse Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.An increment of one standard deviation in RuminococcaceaeUCG003 was associated with a 25% increased risk of cholecystitis (OR = 1.25, 95%CI = 1.01-1.54, p = 0.04), along with a 3% decrease in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (OR = 0.97, 95%CI = 0.944-0.998, p = 0.04). However, following the rigorous Bonferroni correction, every one standard deviation decrease in circulating vitamin D levels was associated with a 33% increased risk of cholecystitis (OR = 0.67, 95%CI = 0.49-0.90, p = 0.008, Padjust = 0.04). Thus, the potential link between gut microbiota and cholecystitis risk might be mediated by circulating vitamin D levels (proportion mediated = 5.5%). Sensitivity analyses provided no evidence of pleiotropy.Our study results suggest that an elevated abundance of specific gut microbiota is associated with an increased susceptibility to cholecystitis, with the causal relationship being mediated by circulating vitamin D levels. Further large-scale randomized controlled trials are necessary to validate the causal effects of gut microbiota on cholecystitis risk. This study provides novel insights into cholecystitis prevention through the regulation of gut microbiota.Copyright © 2023 Miao, Xiao, Xu, Huang, Liu and Chen.",

Recent studies suggest that male fertility function is closely linked to the gut microbiota, however, the cause-and-effect association between the gut microbiota and male infertility risk is currently unclear.We performed one two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study, which uses summary data on human gut microbiota from the MiBioGen consortium as factors of exposure. FinnGen Consortium R8 data was used to obtain GWAS data for male infertility. To evaluate cause-and-effect associations linking gut microbiota and male infertility risk with multiple Mendelian randomization methods, we included inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, and Maximum Likelihood (ML) Ratio. The heterogeneity of instrumental variables was evaluated through Cochran's Q, Rucker's Q, and leave-one-out analysis methods.We found a positive association between Allisonella, Anaerotruncus, Barnesiella, Intestinibacter, and Lactococcus with male infertility risk according to the MR analysis results. Bacteroides Romboutsia, Ruminococcaceae (NK4A2140group), and Ruminococcaceae (UCG011) play a protective function in male infertility pathogenesis.It was found that gut microbiota and infertility are causally related in this study. In subsequent studies, there is a need to build a larger and more comprehensive GWAS database on male infertility, which will reveal the underlying mechanisms for gut microbiota and male infertility. There is a need for randomized controlled trials for validating the protective effect of the associated gut microbiota against male infertility risk, and for exploring the associated mechanisms.Copyright © 2023 Fu, Wang and Yan.",

         "Numerous observational studies have indicated a link between the composition of gut microbiota and thyroid function. Nevertheless, the precise causal relationship between gut microbiota and thyroid function remains uncertain.In this two-sample Mendelian randomization study, we utilized summary data from a genome-wide association study of gut microbiota composition in 18,340 participants from 24 cohorts, as well as summary statistics on thyroid hormones and thyroid-stimulating hormone from the ThyroidOmics Consortium and summary statistics on hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism from the FinnGen R8 release. Five different methods, including inverse variance weighting, MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode, were employed to examine the causal relationship between gut microbiota and thyroid function. Reverse Mendelian randomization analysis was conducted for taxa identified as having a causal relationship with thyroid function in the Mendelian randomization analysis. To assess the robustness of the results, sensitivity analyses were conducted employing Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, MR-PRESSO global test, and leave-one-out analysis.Through MR analysis of 211 microbial taxa and 4 phenotypes, we identified a total of 34 gut microbiota taxa that were associated with the outcomes. After using the bonferroni method for multiple testing correction, phylum Actinobacteria (id.400) had a protective effect on hypothyroidism (OR=0.883, 95% CI: 0.817-0.955, P=0.002), and class Deltaproteobacteria (id.3087) had a protective effect on hyperthyroidism (OR=0.549, 95% CI: 0.374-0.805, P=0.002). According to the results of reverse MR analysis, no significant causal effect of the four phenotypes was found on gut microbiota. No significant horizontal pleiotropy was detected based on MR-Egger intercept test and MR-PRESSO global test.Through two-sample MR analysis, we identified specific gut microbiota taxa at the genetic level that are predicted to have a causal relationship with thyroid function, which may serve as useful biomarkers for early disease diagnosis.Copyright © 2023 Xie, Zhao and Chen.",

         "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified host genetic variants associated with paratuberculosis (PTB) susceptibility. Most of the GWAS-identified SNPs are in non-coding regions. Connecting these non-coding variants and downstream affected genes is a challenge and, up to date, only a few functional mutations or expression quantitative loci (cis-eQTLs) associated with PTB susceptibility have been identified. In the current study, the associations between imputed whole-genome sequence genotypes and whole RNA-Sequencing data from peripheral blood (PB) and ileocecal valve (ICV) samples of Spanish Holstein cows (N = 16) were analyzed with TensorQTL. This approach allowed the identification of 88 and 37 cis-eQTLs regulating the expression levels of 90 and 37 genes in PB and ICV samples, respectively (False discorey rate, FDR ≤ 0.05). Next, we applied summary-based data Mendelian randomization (SMR) to integrate the cis-eQTL dataset with GWAS data obtained from a cohort of 813 culled cattle that were classified according to the presence or absence of PTB-associated histopathological lesions in gut tissues. After multiple testing corrections (FDR ≤ 0.05), we identified two novel cis-eQTLs affecting the expression of the early growth response factor 4 (EGR4) and the bovine neuroblastoma breakpoint family member 6-like protein isoform 2 (MGC134040) that showed pleiotropic associations with the presence of multifocal and diffuse lesions in gut tissues; P = 0.002 and P = 0.017, respectively. While EGR4 acts as a brake on T-cell proliferation and cytokine production through interaction with the nuclear factor Kappa β (NF-κß), MGC134040 is a target gene of NF-κß. Our findings provide a better understanding of the genetic factors influencing PTB outcomes, confirm that the multifocal lesions are localized/confined lesions that have different underlying host genetics than the diffuse lesions, and highlight regulatory SNPs and regulated-gene targets to design future functional studies.© 2023.

However, it is unclear whether previously observed associations reflect causal relationships.This study estimated the genetic association between various immune-related diseases and AR using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR).Eight immune-related diseases were selected as exposure factors, and AR was selected as the outcome. The 8 immune-related disease categories included atopic dermatitis (AD), Graves' disease (GD), asthma, Crohn's disease (CD), multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and ulcerative colitis (UC). Data from GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies) were selected to construct instrumental variables (IVs) for each disease, and multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected as IVs. Corresponding data were retrieved according to the selected SNPs, and all data were summarized and analyzed.A total of 416 SNPs were screened as IVs, and the results of IVW support a causal relationship between AR risk and AD (OR: 1.026, 95% CI: 1.014-1.038, P = 9.59 × 10-6), asthma (OR: 1.057, 95% CI: 1.029-1.086, P = .0001), and CD (OR: 1.006, 95% CI: 1.002-1.011, P = .0085).

In practice, data on the exposure variable can be incomplete due to high cost of measurement and technical limits of detection. In this paper, we propose a valid and efficient method to handle both unmeasured and undetectable values of the exposure variable in one-sample Mendelian randomization analysis with individual-level data. We estimate the causal effect of the exposure variable on the outcome using maximum likelihood estimation and develop an expectation maximization algorithm for the computation of the estimator. Simulation studies show that the proposed method performs well in making inference on the causal effect. We apply our method to the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, a community-based prospective cohort study, and estimate the causal effect of several metabolites on phenotypes of interest.Published by Elsevier Inc.",

Therefore, the purpose of this Mendelian randomization (MR) study was to investigate the potential causal relationship between genetically predicted antioxidants, minerals, and vitamins, and MetS.In this study, we utilized genetic variation as instrumental variable (IV) to capture exposure data related to commonly consumed dietary nutrients, including antioxidants (β-carotene, lycopene, and uric acid), minerals (copper, calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, and selenium), and vitamins (folate, vitamin A, B6, B12, C, D, E, and K1). The outcomes of interest, namely MetS (n = 291,107), waist circumference (n = 462,166), hypertension (n = 463,010), fasting blood glucose (FBG) (n = 281,416), triglycerides (n = 441,016), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (n = 403,943), were assessed using pooled data obtained from the most comprehensive genome-wide association study (GWAS) available. Finally, we applied the inverse variance weighting method as the result and conducted a sensitivity analysis for further validation.Genetically predicted higher iron (OR = 1.070, 95% CI 1.037-1.105, P = 2.91E-05) and magnesium levels (OR = 1.130, 95% CI 1.058-1.208, P = 2.80E-04) were positively associated with increased risk of MetS. For each component of MetS, higher level of genetically predicted selenium (OR = 0.971, 95% CI 0.957-0.986, P = 1.09E-04) was negatively correlated with HDL-C levels, while vitamin K1 (OR = 1.023, 95% CI 1.012-1.033, P = 2.90E-05) was positively correlated with HDL-C levels. Moreover, genetically predicted vitamin D (OR = 0.985, 95% CI 0.978-0.992, P = 5.51E-5) had a protective effect on FBG levels. Genetically predicted iron level (OR = 1.043, 95% CI 1.022-1.064, P = 4.33E-05) had a risk effect on TG level.Our study provides evidence that genetically predicted some specific, but not all, antioxidants, minerals, and vitamins may be causally related to the development of MetS traits.© 2023.

In this study, we performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to assess the associations of genetically determined liver fat, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and body mass index (BMI) with the risk of PLC. The summary statistics of exposures were obtained from two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) based on the UK Biobank (UKB) imaging cohort and the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort. GWAS summary statistics for PLC were obtained from FinnGen consortium R7 release data, including 304 PLC cases and 218 488 controls. Inverse-variance weighted (IVW) was used as the primary analysis, and a series of sensitivity analyses were performed to further verify the robustness of these findings. IVW analysis highlighted a significant association of genetically determined liver fat (OR per SD increase: 7.14; 95% CI: 5.10-9.99; P = 2.35E-30) and VAT (OR per SD increase: 5.70; 95% CI: 1.32-24.72; P = .020) with PLC but not of BMI with PLC. The findings were further confirmed by a series of MR methods. No evidence of horizontal pleiotropy between these associations existed. Our study suggested that genetically determined liver fat and VAT rather than BMI were associated with an increased risk of PLC, which suggested that visceral fat distribution is more predictive of the clinical risk of PLC than common in vitro measures.© 2023 The Authors.

With the advancement of Mendelian randomization research in IBD, we have gained new insights into the relationship between these factors and IBD. Many animal models of IBD have been developed using different methods, but few studies have attempted to model IBD by combining environmental factors and microbial factors. In this review, we examine how environmental factors and microbial factors affect the development and progression of IBD, and how they interact with each other and with the intestinal microbiota. We also summarize the current methods for creating animal models of IBD and compare their advantages and disadvantages. Based on the latest findings from Mendelian randomization studies on the role of environmental factors in IBD, we discuss which environmental and microbial factors could be used to construct a more realistic and reliable IBD experimental model. We propose that animal models of IBD should consider both environmental and microbial factors to better mimic human IBD pathogenesis and to reveal the underlying mechanisms of IBD at the immune and genetic levels. We highlight the importance of environmental and microbial factors in IBD pathogenesis and offer new perspectives and suggestions for improving experimental animal modeling.

         "This study aims to investigate the potential bidirectional causal relationship between myopia and vitreous disorders from a genetic perspective, as vitreous disorders have been found to be closely associated with myopia development.To achieve this, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) design was employed. The study utilized pooled statistics from independent genome-wide association studies. Myopia was chosen as the exposure factor, while five different vitreous disorders were considered as outcomes. The primary analytical method was the inverse variance weighting (IVW) method, supplemented by sensitivity analysis.The study yielded significant findings indicating a positive association between myopia and vitreous disorders. The genetic prediction of myopia consistently demonstrated a positive correlation with vitreous disorders, as evidenced by IVW (odds ratio [OR] = 18.387; P < 0.01), MR Egger (OR = 2784.954; P < 0.01), weighted median (OR = 30.284; P < 0.01), and weighted mode (OR = 57.381; P < 0.01). All sensitivity analyses further validated these associations. Furthermore, a significant association was observed between myopia and other unspecified vitreous body disorders (IVW: OR = 57.729; P < 0.01).Studies mainly conducted in European populations have confirmed that myopia, extending beyond early high myopia, plays a crucial role in influencing vitreous disorders and that there is a unidirectional causal relationship between myopia and vitreous disorders. Additionally, a causal relationship was identified between myopia and other unspecified vitreous disordes. These findings introduce fresh perspectives for the clinical management of unspecified vitreous disorders and contribute to the understanding of the effect of myopia on vitreous disorders. Myopia prevention and treatment will aid in slowing down the process of vitreous liquefaction and subsequently decrease the incidence of malignant eye conditions.© 2023.

         "Growing evidence supports an association between physical activity (PA) and the risk of osteoarthritis (OA), but this may be influenced by confounding and reverse causality. Therefore, we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to reveal the causal relationship between PA and OA.MR was performed to explore the causation of PA and OA with genetic variants as instrumental variables. The genetic variants were derived from the summary statistics of a large genome-wide association study meta-analysis based on the European population (n = 661,399), including self-reported leisure screen time (LST) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and Arthritis Research UK Osteoarthritis Genetics Consortium cohorts (417,596, 393,873 and 403,124 for overall, hip and knee OA, respectively). The major MR analysis used in this work was the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach, and sensitivity, pleiotropy, and heterogeneity studies were performed to evaluate the validity of the findings.IVW estimates indicated that LST had a risk effect on overall OA (odds ratio (OR) = 1.309, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.198-1.430, P = 2.330 × 10-9), hip OA (OR = 1.132, 95% CI: 1.009-1.269, P = 0.034) and knee OA (OR = 1.435. 95% CI: 1.286-1.602, P = 1.225 × 10-10). In contrast, no causal relationship was found between MVPA and OA (overall OA: OR = 0.895, 95% CI: 0.664-1.205, P = 0.465; hip OA: OR = 1.189, 95% CI: 0.792-1.786, P = 0.404; knee OA: OR = 0.707, 95% CI: 0.490 -1.021, P = 0.064). In addition, we observed significant heterogeneity in instrumental variables, but no horizontal pleiotropy was detected.Recent findings demonstrated a protective impact of reducing LST on OA, independent of MVPA. This provides valuable insights into the role of physical activity in OA and offers lifestyle recommendations, such as reducing recreational sedentary behaviors and promoting appropriate exercise, for individuals at risk of OA.© 2023.

Our objective is to elucidate the causal relationship between malignant lymphoma and BC through Mendelian randomization (MR). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data from 181,125 Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients and 181,289 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients from the FinnGen Consortium were utilized as exposure. We selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) strongly associated with the exposure as instrumental variables to investigate their relationship with BC in a cohort of 107,722 participants. Subsequently, we obtained data from the UK Biobank containing gender-stratified information on HL, NHL, and BC. We validated the findings from our analysis and explored the impact of gender.

We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to determine associations between genetic liability to iron overload and the risk of COVID-19 severity and mortality. From genome-wide association studies of European ancestry, single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with liver iron (n = 32,858) and ferritin (n = 23,986) were selected as exposure instruments, and summary statistics of the hospitalization (n = 16,551) and mortality (n = 15,815) of COVID-19 were utilized as the outcome. We used the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method as the primary analysis to estimate causal effects, and other alternative approaches as well as comprehensive sensitivity analysis were conducted for estimating the robustness of identified associations. Genetically predicted high liver iron levels were associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality based on the results of IVW analysis (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.05-1.82, P = 0.02). Likewise, sensitivity analyses showed consistent and robust results in general (all P > 0.05). A higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization trend was also observed in patients with high liver iron levels without statistical significance. This study suggests that COVID-19 mortality might be partially driven by the iron accumulation in the liver, supporting the classification of iron overload as one of the independent death risk factors. Therefore, avoiding iron overload and maintaining normal iron levels may be a powerful measure to reduce COVID-19 mortality.© 2023.

Genetic data related to peripheral blood sorting counts of leukocytes were collected from a genome-wide association study by Blood Cell Consortium (BCX). Single nucleotide polymorphic loci predicting peripheral blood sorting counts of these leukocytes were selected as instrumental variables according to the correlation assumption, independence assumption and exclusivity assumption of MR. The data on breast cancer and its subtypes were obtained from Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) and FinnGen Consortium. In this study, the Inverse-Variance Weighted (IVW), Weighted Median, MR-Egger, Maximum Likelihood (ML), MR-PRESSO and Constrained Maximum Likelihood and Model Averaging (cML-MA) methods of random effects models were used for MR analysis. Cochran's Q analysis, and MR-Egger intercept analysis were applied for sensitivity analysis. IVW and cML-MA were considered the primary analytical tools, and the results of the other 4 MRs were used as complementary and validation. The results suggest that there is no significant causal relationship between leukocyte count and breast cancer risk (IVW OR = 0.98 [95% CI: 0.93-1.03], p-value = 0.35; CML-MA OR = 1.01 [95% CI: 0.98-1.05], p-value = 0.51).

In this study, we conducted a nested case-control study utilizing a follow-up cohort, resulting in the collection of 47 HDP patients and 30 healthy controls. The GM profiles were explored using 16S rRNA sequencing at three time points during pregnancy. The diversity analysis of GM showed no significant difference between HDP patients and controls, however, we found 21 differential GM during pregnancy. Trend analysis showed that there are statistical differences in the relative abundance of Thermomonas, Xanthomonas, and Phenylobacteriumat during pregnancy in the gestational hypertension group, and of Xanthomonas, Polycyclovorans, and Phenylobacterium in the control group. The correlation study found that six genera of GM are related to blood pressure. Furthermore, the MR analysis identified the causal relationship between Methanobrevibacter and pre-eclampsia (PE). This study first explored the longitudinal change of GM in HDP patients during pregnancy, found the differential GM, and detected the causal association.

We performed bidirectional MR analyses to explore the causal relationships between the GM and stroke, and two mediation analyses, two-step MR and multivariable MR, to discover potential mediating metabolites.Ten taxa were causally associated with stroke, and stroke led to changes in 27 taxa. In the two-step MR, Bifidobacteriales order, Bifidobacteriaceae family, Desulfovibrio genus, apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), phospholipids in high-density lipoprotein (HDL_PL), and the ratio of apolipoprotein B to ApoA1 (ApoB/ApoA1) were causally associated with stroke (all P<0.044). The causal associations between Bifidobacteriales order, Bifidobacteriaceae family and stroke were validated using the weighted median method in an independent cohort. The three GM taxa were all positively associated with ApoA1 and HDL_PL, whereas Desulfovibrio genus was negatively associated with ApoB/ApoA1 (all P<0.010). Additionally, the causal associations between the three GM taxa and ApoA1 remained significant after correcting for the false discovery rate (all q-values <0.027). Multivariable MR showed that the associations between Bifidobacteriales order, Bifidobacteriaceae family and stroke were mediated by ApoA1 and HDL_PL, each accounting for 6.5% (P=0.028) and 4.6% (P=0.033); the association between Desulfovibrio genus and stroke was mediated by ApoA1, HDL_PL, and ApoB/ApoA1, with mediated proportions of 7.6% (P=0.019), 4.2% (P=0.035), and 9.1% (P=0.013), respectively.The current MR study provides evidence supporting the causal relationships between several specific GM taxa and stroke and potential mediating metabolites.",

The genome-wide threshold was 1 × 10-5 in the forward MR analysis and was 5 × 10-8 in the reverse MR analysis. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) was the main method to analyse causality, and MR results were verified by several sensitivity analyses including weighted median, MR Egger, and MR Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier (PRESSO).The IVW method suggested that eight taxa were positively correlated with RA, including: MollicutesRF9 (pIVW <0.01), Alphaproteobacteria (pIVW <0.01), Betaproteobacteria (p IVW =0.04), Bacteroidaceae (pIVW <0.01), Adlercreutzia (pIVW <0.01), Bacteroides (pIVW <0.01), Butyricimonas (p IVW =0.03) and Holdemanella (pIVW =0.03). Six bacterial taxa were negatively correlated with RA, including Desulfovibrionales (pIVW = 0.01), Methanobacteriales (pIVW <0.01), Methanobacteria (PIVW <0.01), Desulfovibrionaceae (pIVW <0.01), Methanobacteriaceae (pIVW <0.01) and Butyrivibrio (pIVW =0.02). Heterogeneity (p>0.05) and pleiotropy (p>0.05) analysis confirmed the robustness of the MR results.We identified some specific bacterial taxa that were causally associated with the risk of RA, providing new insights into prevention and diagnosis of RA.",

         "As a key adipokine, leptin has been extensively investigated for its potential role in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, concordant conclusions have not been attained. In this study, we investigated the relationship between leptin and COPD using an integrative analysis that combined a Mendelian randomization (MR) study with transcriptomic data analysis. Here, the MR analysis was performed on the online platform MR-Base, and the bioinformatics analyses were performed with the aid of R Bioconductor packages. No evidence was found by the integrative analysis to support the association of the two attributes. All methods detected a null causal effect of leptin on COPD in the MR analysis. In particular, when the genetically predicted leptin level increased one unit, the risk of developing COPD was estimated as 0.999 (p = 0.943), 0.920 (p = 0.516), 1.002 (p = 0.885), and 1.002 (p = 0.906) by the Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode method, respectively. Furthermore, no leptin-associated genes except one were identified as being differentially expressed between COPD and control in bioinformatics analysis. The observed association between leptin and COPD in previous observational studies may be attributable to unmeasured confounding effects or reverse causation.",
