         "Alcohol consumption significantly impacts disease burden and has been linked to various diseases in observational studies. However, comprehensive meta-analyses using Mendelian randomization (MR) to examine drinking patterns are limited. We aimed to evaluate the health risks of alcohol use by integrating findings from MR studies. A thorough search was conducted for MR studies focused on alcohol exposure. We utilized two sets of instrumental variables-alcohol consumption and problematic alcohol use-and summary statistics from the FinnGen consortium R9 release to perform de novo MR analyses. Our meta-analysis encompassed 64 published and 151 de novo MR analyses across 76 distinct primary outcomes. Results show that a genetic predisposition to alcohol consumption, independent of smoking, significantly correlates with a decreased risk of Parkinson's disease, prostate hyperplasia, and rheumatoid arthritis. It was also associated with an increased risk of chronic pancreatitis, colorectal cancer, and head and neck cancers. Additionally, a genetic predisposition to problematic alcohol use is strongly associated with increased risks of alcoholic liver disease, cirrhosis, both acute and chronic pancreatitis, and pneumonia. Evidence from our MR study supports the notion that alcohol consumption and problematic alcohol use are causally associated with a range of diseases, predominantly by increasing the risk.",

         "The aim of this study was to assess the causal relationships between mineral metabolism disorders, representative of trace elements, and key aging biomarkers: telomere length (TL) and mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN). Utilizing bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis in combination with the two-stage least squares (2SLS) method, we explored the causal relationships between mineral metabolism disorders and these aging indicators. Sensitivity analysis can be used to determine the reliability and robustness of the research results. The results confirmed that a positive causal relationship was observed between mineral metabolism disorders and TL (p < 0.05), while the causal relationship with mtDNA-CN was not significant (p > 0.05). Focusing on subgroup analyses of specific minerals, our findings indicated a distinct positive causal relationship between iron metabolism disorders and both TL and mtDNA-CN (p < 0.05). In contrast, disorders in magnesium and phosphorus metabolism did not exhibit significant causal effects on either aging biomarker (p > 0.05). Moreover, reverse MR analysis did not reveal any significant causal effects of TL and mtDNA-CN on mineral metabolism disorders (p > 0.05). The combination of 2SLS with MR analysis further reinforced the positive causal relationship between iron levels and both TL and mtDNA-CN (p < 0.05). Notably, the sensitivity analysis did not indicate significant pleiotropy or heterogeneity within these causal relationships (p > 0.05). These findings highlight the pivotal role of iron metabolism in cellular aging, particularly in regulating TL and sustaining mtDNA-CN, offering new insights into how mineral metabolism disorders influence aging biomarkers. Our research underscores the importance of trace element balance, especially regarding iron intake, in combating the aging process. This provides a potential strategy for slowing aging through the adjustment of trace element intake, laying the groundwork for future research into the relationship between trace elements and healthy aging.",

This study sought to employ a Mendelian randomization analysis to screen the specific gut microbiota and plasma metabolome, which may have a causal effect on lung cancer. We further extended our analysis to estimate the effects of these exposures on various pathological subtypes of lung cancer. Furthermore, a mediation analysis was performed to identify the potential pathway underlying the influence of microbiota and metabolites. Our study identified 13 taxa and 15 metabolites with a causal association with the overall risk of lung cancer. Furthermore, we found 8 taxa and 14 plasma metabolites with a causal effect on lung adenocarcinoma, 4 taxa and 10 metabolites with a causal effect on squamous cell lung carcinoma, and 7 taxa and 16 metabolites with a causal effect on SCLC. We also identified seven mediation pathways that could potentially elucidate the influence of these microbiota and metabolites on overall lung cancer or special subtypes. Our study highlighted the heterogeneity of the gut microbiome and plasma metabolome in a lung cancer subtype and elucidated the potential underlying mechanisms. This could pave the way for more personalized lung cancer prevention and treatment.",

         "Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is a multifactorial disorder with potential links to various physiological systems, including the cardiovascular system via blood lipid levels such as triglycerides (TG). This study investigates the causal relationship between TG levels and SNHL using Mendelian randomization (MR), which offers a method to reduce confounding and reverse causality by using genetic variants as instrumental variables.Utilizing publicly available genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, we performed a two-sample MR analysis. The initial analysis unveiled a causal relationship between TG (GWAS ID: ebi-a-GCST90018975) and SNHL (GWAS ID: finn b-H8_HL_SEN-NAS). Subsequent analysis validated this through MR with a larger sample size for TG (GWAS ID: ieu-b-111) and SNHL. To conduct the MR analysis, we utilized several methods including inverse-variance weighted (IVW), MR Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode. We also employed Cochrane's Q test to identify any heterogeneity in the MR results. To detect horizontal pleiotropy, we conducted the MR-Egger intercept test and MR pleiotropy residual sum and outliers (MR-PRESSO) test. We performed a leave-one-out analysis to assess the sensitivity of this association. Finally, a meta-analysis of the MR results was undertaken.Our study found a significant positive correlation between TG and SNHL, with OR values of 1.14 (95% CI: 1.07-1.23, p < 0.001) in the IVW analysis and 1.09 (95% CI: 1.03-1.16, p < 0.006) in the replicate analysis. We also found no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity between the genetic variants (p > 0.05), and a leave-one-out test confirmed the stability and robustness of this association. The meta-analysis combining the initial and replicate analyses showed a significant causal effect with OR values of 1.11 (95% CI: 1.06-1.16, p = 0.01).These findings indicate TG as a risk factor for SNHL, suggesting potential pathways for prevention and intervention in populations at risk. This conclusion underscores the importance of managing TG levels as a strategy to mitigate the risk of developing SNHL.",

         "Pre-pregnancy obesity was associated with gestational diabetes in observational studies, but whether this relationship is causal remains to be determined. To evaluate whether pre-pregnancy obesity traits causally affect gestational diabetes risk, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed utilizing summary-level statistics from published genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Obesity-related traits included body mass index (BMI), overweight, obesity, obesity class 1, obesity class 2, obesity class 3, childhood obesity, waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), percent liver fat, visceral adipose tissue volume, abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue volume. Effect estimates were evaluated using the inverse-variance weighting method. Weighted median, MR-Egger, simple mode, and weighted mode were performed as sensitivity analyses. Genetically predicted pre-pregnancy BMI [odds ratio (OR) = 1.68; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.45-1.95; P = 9.13 × 10-12], overweight (OR = 1.49; 95% CI: 1.21-1.85; P = 2.06 × 10-4), obesity (OR = 1.25; 95% CI: 1.18-1.33; P = 8.01 × 10-13), obesity class 1 (OR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.17-1.46; P = 1.49 × 10-6), obesity class 2 (OR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.16-1.37; P = 5.23 × 10-8), childhood obesity (OR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.23-1.44; P = 4.06 × 10-12), and WHR (OR = 2.35; 95% CI: 1.44-3.83; P = 5.89 × 10-4) were associated with increased risk of gestational diabetes. No significant association was observed with obesity class 3, WC, HC, percent liver fat, visceral adipose tissue volume, or abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue volume. Similar results were observed in sensitivity analyses. Therefore, genetically predicted pre-pregnancy obesity traits may increase the risk of gestational diabetes. Weight control before pregnancy may be beneficial to prevent gestational diabetes.© 2024. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Society for Reproductive Investigation.",

         "Mendelian randomisation (MR) is an established technique in epidemiological investigation, using the principle of random allocation of genetic variants at conception to estimate the causal linear effect of an exposure on an outcome. Extensions to this technique include non-linear approaches that allow for differential effects of the exposure on the outcome depending on the level of the exposure. A widely used non-linear method is the residual approach, which estimates the causal effect within different strata of the non-genetically predicted exposure (i.e. the \"residual\" exposure). These \"local\" causal estimates are then used to make inferences about non-linear effects. Recent work has identified that this method can lead to estimates that are seriously biased, and a new method-the doubly-ranked method-has been introduced as a possibly more robust approach. In this paper, we perform negative control outcome analyses in the MR context. These are analyses with outcomes onto which the exposure should have no predicted causal effect. Using both methods we find clearly biased estimates in certain situations. We additionally examined a situation for which there are robust randomised controlled trial estimates of effects-that of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction onto myocardial infarction, where randomised trials have provided strong evidence of the shape of the relationship. The doubly-ranked method did not identify the same shape as the trial data, and for LDL-C and other lipids they generated some highly implausible findings. Therefore, we suggest there should be extensive simulation and empirical methodological examination of performance of both methods for NLMR under different conditions before further use of these methods. In the interim, use of NLMR methods needs justification, and a number of sanity checks (such as analysis of negative and positive control outcomes, sensitivity analyses excluding removal of strata at the extremes of the distribution, examination of biological plausibility and triangulation of results) should be performed.© 2024.

There was no evidence for bidirectional causal association between thyroid function mentioned above and MDD among both ancestry (all P > 0.05).We importantly observed a significant causal association between MDD on risk of hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and hashimoto's thyroiditis among European ancestry, and Alcohol intake and antidepressant as mediators for prevention of hypothyroidism, hashimoto's thyroiditis attributable to MDD.Copyright © 2024.

The inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, and MR-Egger were used to obtain the causal estimates. Findings were verified through extensive sensitivity analyses and validated using another dataset. Multivariable MR (MVMR) analysis was performed to estimate the direct causal effects with adjustment of potential confounders. Two-step MR technique was then conducted to explore the mediators in the causal effects of neuroticism on frailty.Genetically-predicted higher neuroticism score was significantly correlated with higher frailty index (IVW beta: 0.53, 95%CI: 0.48 to 0.59, P = 9.3E-83), and genetically-determined higher frailty index was significantly associated with higher neuroticism score (IVW beta: 0.28, 95%CI: 0.21 to 0.35, P = 1.3E-16). These results remained robust across sensitivity analyses and were reproducible using another dataset. The MVMR analysis indicated that the causal relationships remained significant after adjusting for the potential confounding factors. Mediation analysis revealed that depression, years of schooling, and smoking were significantly mediated the causal effects of neuroticism on frailty.A bidirectional causal relationship existed between neuroticism and frailty. Our findings suggested that early intervention and behavioral changes might be helpful to reduce the neuroticism levels and prevent the development of frailty.Copyright © 2024.

Methods such as inverse variance weighting, MR-Egger regression, weighted median approaches, MR-PRESSO, and multivariable MR (MVMR) analysis were utilized. The analysis indicated an association between higher levels of C-C motif chemokine 4 and a reduced risk of TAO, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.44 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.29-0.67; p = 1.4 × 10-4; adjusted p = 0.013). Similarly, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor exhibited a suggestively protective effect against TAO (OR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.22-0.81; p = 0.010; adjusted p = 0.218). Conversely, higher levels of C-C motif chemokine 23 were suggestively linked to an increased risk of TAO (OR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.21-2.93; p = 0.005; adjusted p = 0.218). The sensitivity analysis and MVMR revealed no evidence of heterogeneity or pleiotropy. This study identifies C-C motif chemokine 4 and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor as potential protective biomarkers for TAO, whereas C-C motif chemokine 23 emerges as a suggestive risk marker. These findings elucidate potential causal relationships and highlight the significance of these proteins in the pathogenesis and prospective therapeutic strategies for TAO.The Author(s).

         "Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is an age-related inflammatory disease of unknown cause. We aimed to identify potentially modifiable risk factors and therapeutic targets for preventing or treating PMR.We meta-analysed genetic association data from 8,156 cases of PMR (defined using diagnostic codes and self-report) and 416,495 controls of European ancestry from the UK Biobank and FinnGen. We then performed Mendelian randomization analyses to estimate the association between eight modifiable risk factors (using data from up to 1.2 million individuals) and 65 inflammation-related circulating proteins (up to 55,792 individuals), using the inverse variance weighted and pleiotropy robust methods.We identified three novel genome-wide significant loci in the IL1R1, NEK6 and CCDC88B genes and confirmation of previously described associations with HLA-DRB1 and ANKRD55. Genetically predicted smoking intensity (OR 1.32; 95%CI 1.08-1.60; p = 0.006) and visceral adiposity (OR 1.22; 95%CI 1.10-1.37; p = 3.10x10-4) were associated with PMR susceptibility. Multiple circulating proteins related to IL-1 family signaling were associated with PMR. IL-1 receptor-like 2, also known as IL-36 receptor (OR 1.25; p = 1.89x10-32), serum amyloid A2 (OR 1.06, 9.91x10-10) and CXCL6 (OR 1.09, p = 4.85x10-7) retained significance after correction for multiple testing.Reducing smoking and visceral adiposity at a population level might reduce incidence of PMR. We identified proteins that may play causal roles in PMR, potentially suggesting new therapeutic opportunities. Further research is needed before these findings are applied to clinical practice.© The Author(s) 2024. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Society for Rheumatology.

         "Multiple studies have demonstrated that the gut microbiome is closely related to the onset of Alzheimer's disease, but the causal relationship between the gut microbiome and AD, as well as potential mediating factors, have not been fully explored.Our aim is to validate the causal relationship between the gut microbiome and the onset of AD and determine the key mechanism by which the gut microbiome mediates AD through blood metabolites using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis methods.We first conducted bidirectional and mediating MR analyses using gut microbiota, blood amino acid metabolites, and AD-related single nucleotide polymorphisms as research data. In the analysis process, the inverse variance-weighted average method was mainly used as the primary method, with other methods serving as supplementary evidence.Ultimately, we found that six types of gut bacteria and two blood amino acid metabolites have a causal effect on AD. Subsequent mediation analysis proved that decreased glutamine concentration mediates the negative causal effect of Holdemanella bacteria on AD (mediation ratio of 14.5%), and increased serum alanine concentration mediates the positive causal effect of Parabacteroide bacteria on AD (mediation ratio of 9.4%).Our study demonstrates the causality of Holdemanella and Parabacteroides bacteria in the onset of AD and suggests that the reduced glutamine and increased alanine serums concentration may be key nodes in mediating this effect.",

         "Patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) usually have an imbalance in the gut microbiota (GM); however, whether this is a causal correlation remains unclear. This study used summary data from an open genome-wide association study to conduct double-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to test the causal correlation between GM and ICH. First, we used a cutoff value of P < 10E-5 to select single nucleotide polymorphisms critical for each GM. Inverse variance weighted, weighted median, and MR-PRESSO methods were used to evaluate the strength of this causal association. Finally, functional maps and annotations from genome-wide association studies were used to determine the biological functions of the genes. MR analysis revealed that Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group was significantly positively correlated with ICH risk. For every unit increase in Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, the relative risk of ICH increased by 34.4%(P = 4.62E-04). Rhodospirillales, Terrisporobacter, Veillonellaceae, Coprococcus 3, unknown genus, Alphaproteobacteria, and Allisonella groups were negatively correlated with the risk of ICH, while Anaerofilum, Eubacteriumbrachy group, Clostridia, Howardella, and Romboutsia were negatively correlated with the risk of ICH. Nonetheless, the specific role of single nucleotide polymorphisms gene enrichment requires further investigation. This study suggests the causal effect on ICH. The discovery of >10 GMs associated with ICH could be used to prevent and treat ICH.Copyright © 2024 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",

         "An association has been observed between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in observational studies, however, the exact causal link remains unclear. We aim to evaluate the causal relationships between SLE and PBC through bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected as instrumental variables from publicly accessible genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in European populations. The PBC and SLE GWAS data were obtained from the MRC IEU Open GWAS database, consisting of 24,510 and 14,267 samples, respectively. After a series of quality control and outlier removal, inverse variance weighted was used as the primary approach to evaluate the causal association between SLE and PBC. The horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity were examined by the MR-Egger intercept test and Cochran Q value, respectively. Seven SNPs were included to examine the causal effect of SLE on PBC. Genetically predicted SLE may increase the risk of PBC development, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.324 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.220 ∼ 1.437, P ˂ .001). Twenty SNPs were included to explore the causal effect of PBC on SLE. Genetically predicted PBC may increase the risk of SLE development, with an OR of 1.414 (95% CI 1.323 ∼ 1.511, P ˂ .001). Horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity were absent (P > .05) among SNPs. The robustness of our results was further enhanced by using the leave-one-out method. Our research has provided new insights into SLE and PBC, indicating bidirectional causal associations between the 2 diseases. These findings offer valuable contributions to future clinical studies.Copyright © 2024 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",

         "Although observational studies have found both a positive and negative association between depression and hypercholesterolemia, the findings are mixed and contradictory. To our knowledge, this is the first study that employs the bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) and multivariable MR analysis with extensive genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data to examine the causal effect between depression and hypercholesterolemia. Using summary statistics obtained from GWAS of individuals with European ancestry, we utilize a bidirectional 2-sample MR approach to explore the potential causal association between hypercholesterolemia and depressive symptoms. Multivariable Mendelian randomization analysis was used to examine whether the direct causal effect of depression on the risk of hypercholesterolemia can be affected by traits associated with the increased risk of hypercholesterolemia. This MR analysis utilized inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger regression, weighted mode, and weighted median methods. Data on the summary level of depression were acquired from a GWAS that involved 500,199 participants. We used summary GWAS datasets for hypercholesterolemia including 206,067 participants. We also used another GWAS databases of hypercholesterolemiat (n = 463,010) to validate our results. By utilizing IVW, it was discovered that there is a possibility of a 31% rise in the risk of hypercholesterolemia due to depression (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.10-1.57, P = .002). We found a consistent causal effect of depression on hypercholesterolemia from the IVW analyses using different hypercholesterolemia datasets. After adjustment of smoking, physical activity, and obesity, there remains significant causal relationship between depression and hypercholesterolemia (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.01-1.54, P = .040). However, we did not find any evidence indicating that hypercholesterolemia leads to depression in the opposite direction. Directional pleiotropy was not observed in the MR-Egger regression analysis. Additionally, the MR-PRESSO analysis validated these discoveries. Neither the leave-one-out sensitivity test nor the funnel plots revealed any outliers. In both the unadjusted and adjusted estimates, depression has a consistent direct causal effect on hypercholesterolemia. Our study has led to an improved comprehension of the causal connections between hypercholesterolemia and depression, which could aid in the prevention and treatment of hypercholesterolemia.Copyright © 2024 the Author(s).

         "Some observational studies have highlighted a significant association between cholecystitis and factors leading to sudden death; however, the specific relationship between the 2 has not been fully elucidated. The primary objective of this study was to elucidate the causal interplay between cholecystitis and augmented risk of sudden cardiac death. We used large-scale genetic summary data from genome-wide association study, genetic summary statistics were sourced from 3 eminent repositories: the UK Biobank (N = 463,010), the FinnGen consortium (N = 215,027), and the European Bioinformatics Institute (N = 471,251). By employing 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to decipher the causal interplay between cholecystitis and sudden death etiologies, a meta-analytical approach was employed to amalgamate the findings derived from these disparate data sources. The primary MR methodologies used included inverse variance weighting with random effects, inverse variance weighting with fixed effects, maximum likelihood, MR-Egger, and weighted median. Subsequently, we performed heterogeneity testing, polyvalency examination, and sensitivity analysis to bolster the robustness of causal relationship assessments. Meta-analysis and amalgamating variegated data sources revealed a statistically significant inverse correlation between cholecystitis and ventricular arrhythmias (odds ratio, 0.896; 95% confidence interval: 0.826-0.971; P = .008). Similarly, an inverse association was observed between cholecystitis and aortic aneurysm (odds ratio, 0.899; 95% confidence interval: 0.851-0.951, P < .001). This study substantiates the absence of a direct causal link between cholecystitis and cerebrovascular accidents (P = .771), pulmonary embolism (P = .071), and acute myocardial infarction (P = .388). A direct causal correlation existed between cholecystitis and sudden death associated with ventricular arrhythmias and aortic aneurysms. The onset of cholecystitis may mitigate the risk of sudden death due to ventricular arrhythmias and aortic aneurysms.Copyright © 2024 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",

         "Previous observational studies have linked inflammatory skin diseases with mental health issues and neuroticism. However, the specific impact of neuroticism and its subclusters (i.e. worry, depressed affect, and sensitivity to environmental stress and adversity) on these conditions remains underexplored. In this work, we explored causal associations between common inflammatory skin diseases and neuroticism. We conducted a two-sample, bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using data from genome-wide association studies in psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, neuroticism and relevant genetic subclusters conducted on participants of European ancestry. Corrections for sample overlap were applied where necessary. We found that psoriasis was causally associated with increased levels of worry (odds ratio, 95% confidence intervals: 1.011, 1.006-1.016, P = 3.84 × 10-6) while none of the neuroticism subclusters showed significant association with psoriasis. Sensitivity analyses revealed considerable evidence of directional pleiotropy between psoriasis and neuroticism traits. Conversely, genetic liability to atopic dermatitis did not exhibit any significant association with neuroticism traits. Notably, genetically predicted worry was linked to an elevated risk of atopic dermatitis (odds ratio, 95% confidence intervals: 1.227, 1.067-1.41, P = 3.97 × 10-3). Correction for overlapping samples confirmed the robustness of these results. These findings suggest potential avenues for future interventions aimed at reducing stress and worry among patients with inflammatory skin conditions.© 2024.

Through IVW analysis, we found 105 plasma metabolites associated with Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), with the highest association observed for Prolylglycine levels (OR [95% CI]: 1.1902 [1.0274, 1.3788]). For Malignant Melanoma of Skin (MSS), 68 plasma metabolites were linked, with the highest causal relationship seen for 3-Hydroxybutyrate levels (OR [95% CI]: 1.0030 [1.0013, 1.0048]). Regarding actinic keratosis (AK), and the highest association observed for Hexadecadienoate (16:2n6) levels (OR [95% CI]: 1.3302 [1.0333, 1.7125]). Glycerol to palmitoylcarnitine (16: n6) levels (OR [95% CI]: 1.3302 [1.0333, 1.125]) were found to be significant for BCC and AK. Palmitoylcarnitine (C16) had the most positive causal effect for BCC (OR [95% CI]: 1.1777 [1.0493, 1.3218]), while 5-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine sulfate levels had the highest effect for AK (OR [95% CI]: 1.1788 [1.0295, 1.3498]). And 4-guanidinobutanoate levels had the largest positive causal effect (OR [95% CI]: 1.0857 [1.0417, 1.1317]) for BCC, and X-11880 levels for MSS (OR [95% CI]: 1.0013 [1.0000, 1.0025]). The study revealed a positive association between hereditary Glycerol to palmitoylcarnitine (C16) and 5-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine sulfate levels with the risk of developing BCC and AK.

With the development of genetic technology, validated genetic information can better explain COPD.The study utilized scRNA-seq and Mendelian randomization analysis of eQTLs to identify crucial genes and potential mechanistic pathways underlying COPD pathogenesis.Single-cell sequencing data were used to identify marker genes for immune cells in the COPD process. Data on eQTLs for immune cell marker genes were obtained from the eQTLGen consortium. To estimate the causal effect of marker genes on COPD, we selected an independent cohort (ukb-b-16751) derived from the UK Biobank database for two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis. Subsequently, we performed immune infiltration analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and co-expression network analysis on the key genes.The 154 immune cell-associated marker genes identified were mainly involved in pathways such as vacuolar cleavage, positive regulation of immune response and regulation of cell activation. Mendelian randomization analysis screened four pairs of marker genes (GZMH, COTL1, CSTA and CD14) were causally associated with COPD. These four key genes were significantly associated with immune cells. In addition, we have identified potential transcription factors associated with these key genes using the Cistrome database, thus contributing to a deeper understanding of the regulatory network of these gene expressions.This eQTLs Mendelian randomization study identified four key genes (GZMH, COTL1, CSTA, and CD14) causally associated with COPD, providing new insights for prevention and treatment of COPD.",

This study aimed to investigate the causal effects of metabolic traits on IS in both East Asian and European populations utilizing multiple MR methods based on genetic insights. Two-sample and multivariable MR were performed, and MR estimates were calculated as inverse-variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, and penalized weighted median. Pleiotropy was assessed by MR-Egger and Mendelian randomization pleiotropy residual sum and outlier tests. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was associated with an increased risk of IS by IVW in both European (ORIVW: 1.032, 95% CI: 1.026-1.038, p < 0.001) and Japanese populations (ORIVW: 1.870, 95% CI: 1.122-3.116, p = 0.016), which was further confirmed by other methods. Unlike the European population, the evidence for the association of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) with IS in the Japanese population was not stable. No evidence supported an association between the other traits and IS (all Ps > 0.05) in both races. A positive association was found between SBP and IS in two races, while the results of DBP were only robust in Europeans.",

This study employed five Mendelian randomization methods (MR Egger, Weighted Median, Inverse Variance Weighted, Simple Mode, and Weighted Mode) to analyze clinical data from 308 obese patients at the People's Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, from January 2015 to June 2023. Patients were divided based on thyroid function tests into normal (n=173) and SCH groups (n=56). Comparative analyses, along with univariate and multivariate logistic regression, were conducted to identify risk factors for SCH in obese patients. A significant association between obesity and hypothyroidism was established, especially highlighted by the Inverse Variance Weighted method. SCH patients showed higher ages, TSH levels, and thyroid autoantibody positivity rates, with lower T4 and FT4 levels. Age, FT4, thyroid autoantibodies, TPO-Ab, and Tg-Ab were confirmed as risk factors. The predictive value of FT4 levels for SCH in obesity was significant, with an AUC of 0.632. The study supports a potential causal link between obesity and hypothyroidism, identifying specific risk factors for SCH in obese patients. FT4 level stands out as an independent predictive factor, suggesting its utility in early diagnosis and preventive strategies for SCH.",

         "Behçet's disease (BD) is a complex autoimmune disorder impacting several organ systems. Although the involvement of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in BD is rare, it can be associated with severe consequences. In the present study, we identified diagnostic biomarkers in patients with BD having AAA. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was initially used to explore the potential causal association between BD and AAA. The Limma package, WGCNA, PPI and machine learning algorithms were employed to identify potential diagnostic genes. A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) for the nomogram was constructed to ascertain the diagnostic value of AAA in patients with BD. Finally, immune cell infiltration analyses and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) were conducted. The MR analysis indicated a suggestive association between BD and the risk of AAA (odds ratio [OR]: 1.0384, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0081-1.0696, p = 0.0126). Three hub genes (CD247, CD2 and CCR7) were identified using the integrated bioinformatics analyses, which were subsequently utilised to construct a nomogram (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.982, 95% CI: 0.944-1.000). Finally, the immune cell infiltration assay revealed that dysregulation immune cells were positively correlated with the three hub genes. Our MR analyses revealed a higher susceptibility of patients with BD to AAA. We used a systematic approach to identify three potential hub genes (CD247, CD2 and CCR7) and developed a nomogram to assist in the diagnosis of AAA among patients with BD. In addition, immune cell infiltration analysis indicated the dysregulation in immune cell proportions.© 2024 The Author(s).

         "Dysregulation of circulating metabolites may affect brain function and cognition, associated with alterations in the cerebral cortex architecture. However, the exact cause remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the causal effect of circulating metabolites on the cerebral cortex architecture.This study utilized retrieved data from genome-wide association studies to investigate the relationship between blood metabolites and cortical architecture. A total of 1,091 metabolites and 309 metabolite ratios were used for exposure. The brain cortex surface area and cortex thickness were selected as the primary outcomes in this study. In this study, the inverse variance weighting method was used as the main analytical method, complemented by sensitivity analyses that were more robust to pleiotropy. Furthermore, metabolic pathway analysis was performed via MetaboAnalyst 6.0. Finally, reverse Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to assess the potential for reverse causation.After correcting for the false discovery rate (FDR), we identified 37 metabolites and 9 metabolite ratios that showed significant causal associations with cortical structures. Among these, Oxalate was found to be most strongly associated with cortical surface area (β: 2387.532, 95% CI 756.570-4018.495, p = 0.037), while Tyrosine was most correlated with cortical thickness (β: -0.015, 95% CI -0.005 to -0.025, p = 0.025). Furthermore, pathway analysis based on metabolites identified six significant metabolic pathways associated with cortical structures and 13 significant metabolic pathways based on metabolite ratios.The identified metabolites and relevant metabolic pathways reveal potential therapeutic pathways for reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. These findings will help guide health policies and clinical practice in treating neurodegenerative diseases.Copyright © 2024 Jiang, Sun and Liu.",

         "According to observational research, migraine may increase the risk of Meniere's disease (MD). The two have not, however, been proven to be causally related.Using Mendelian random (MR) analysis, we aimed to evaluate any potential causal relationship between migraine and MD. We extracted single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involving European individuals, focusing on migraine and MD. The main technique used to evaluate effect estimates was inverse-variance weighting (IVW). To assess heterogeneity and pleiotropy, sensitivity analyses were carried out using weighted median, MR-Egger, simple mode, weighted mode, and MR-PRESSO.There was no discernible causative link between genetic vulnerability to MD and migraine. The migraine dose not increase the prevalence of MD in the random-effects IVW method (OR = 0.551, P = 0.825). The extra weighted median analysis (OR = 0.674, P = 0.909), MR-Egger (OR = 0.068, P = 0.806), Simple mode (OR = 0.170, P = 0.737), and Weighted mode (OR = 0.219, P= 0.760) all showed largely consistent results. The MD dose not increase the prevalence of migraine in the random-effects IVW method (OR = 0.999, P = 0.020).

         "Anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) poses a significant challenge to global public health. Despite extensive research, conclusive evidence regarding the association between gut microbes and the risk of AN and BN remains elusive. Mendelian randomization (MR) methods offer a promising avenue for elucidating potential causal relationships.Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) datasets of AN and BN were retrieved from the OpenGWAS database for analysis. Independent single nucleotide polymorphisms closely associated with 196 gut bacterial taxa from the MiBioGen consortium were identified as instrumental variables. MR analysis was conducted utilizing R software, with outlier exclusion performed using the MR-PRESSO method. Causal effect estimation was undertaken employing four methods, including Inverse variance weighted. Sensitivity analysis, heterogeneity analysis, horizontal multivariate analysis, and assessment of causal directionality were carried out to assess the robustness of the findings.A total of 196 bacterial taxa spanning six taxonomic levels were subjected to analysis. Nine taxa demonstrating potential causal relationships with AN were identified. Among these, five taxa, including Peptostreptococcaceae, were implicated as exerting a causal effect on AN risk, while four taxa, including Gammaproteobacteria, were associated with a reduced risk of AN. Similarly, nine taxa exhibiting potential causal relationships with BN were identified. Of these, six taxa, including Clostridiales, were identified as risk factors for increased BN risk, while three taxa, including Oxalobacteraceae, were deemed protective factors. Lachnospiraceae emerged as a common influence on both AN and BN, albeit with opposing effects. No evidence of heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy was detected for significant estimates.Through MR analysis, we revealed the potential causal role of 18 intestinal bacterial taxa in AN and BN, including Lachnospiraceae. It provides new insights into the mechanistic basis and intervention targets of gut microbiota-mediated AN and BN.Copyright © 2024 Yu, Guo, Yu, Wang, Yan and Gao.",

         "Research based on observation has demonstrated a relationship between sleep traits and frailty; however, it remains uncertain if this correlation indicates causation. The purpose of this study was to look at the causal relationship that exists between frailty and sleep traits.Using summaries from a genome-wide association study of self-reported sleep features and frailty index, we performed a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Examining the causal relationships between seven sleep-related traits and frailty was the goal. The major method used to calculate effect estimates was the inverse-variance weighted method, supplemented by the weighted median and MR-Egger approaches. The study investigated pleiotropy and heterogeneity using several methodologies, such as the MR-Egger intercept, the MR-PRESSO approach, and the Cochran's Q test. We took multivariate Mendelian randomization and genetic correlations between related traits to enhance the confidence of the results. Furthermore, we used MRlap to correct for any estimation bias due to sample overlap.Insomnia, napping during the day, and sleep apnea syndrome exhibited a positive connection with the frailty index in forward MR analysis. Conversely, there is a negative link between getting up in the morning, snoring and sleep duration with the frailty index. During the reverse MR analysis, the frailty index exhibited a positive correlation with insomnia, napping during the day, and sleep apnea syndrome, while demonstrating a negative correlation with sleep duration. There was no direct correlation between snoring, chronotype, and frailty. In MVMR analyses, the causal effect of sleep characteristics on frailty indices remained consistent after adjusting for potential confounders including BMI, smoking, and triglycerides.The findings of our investigation yield novel evidence that substantiates the notion of a bidirectional causal connection between sleep traits and frailty. Through the optimization of sleep, it is potentially feasible to hinder, postpone, or even reverse the state of frailty, and we proposed relevant interventions.Copyright © 2024 Deng, Hu, Duan, Buyang, Huang, Fu, Luo and Hou.",

         "The relationship between obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and diabetic microangiopathy remains controversial.This study aimed to use bidirectional two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) to assess the causal relationship between OSAS and diabetic microangiopathy.First, we used the Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression(LDSC) analysis to assess the genetic correlation. Then, the bidirectional two-sample MR study was conducted in two stages: OSAS and lung function-related indicators (forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)) were investigated as exposures, with diabetic microangiopathy as the outcome in the first stage, and genetic tools were used as proxy variables for OSAS and lung function-related measures in the second step. Genome-wide association study data came from the open GWAS database. We used Inverse-Variance Weighted (IVW), MR-Egger regression, Weighted median, Simple mode, and Weighted mode for effect estimation and pleiotropy testing. We also performed sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the results. Furthermore, we performed multivariate and mediation MR analyses.In the LDSC analysis, We found a genetic correlation between OSAS, FVC, FEV 1, and diabetic microangiopathy. In the MR analysis, based on IVW analysis, genetically predicted OSAS was positively correlated with the incidence of diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and diabetic neuropathy (DN). In the subgroup analysis of DR, there was a significant causal relationship between OSAS and background diabetic retinopathy (BDR) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). The reverse MR did not show a correlation between the incidence of diabetic microangiopathy and OSAS. Reduced FVC had a potential causal relationship with increased incidence of DR and PDR. Reduced FEV1 had a potential causal relationship with the increased incidence of BDR, PDR, and DKD. Multivariate MR analysis showed that the association between OSAS and diabetic microangiopathy remained significant after adjusting for confounding factors. However, we did not find the significant mediating factors.Our results suggest that OSAS may be a cause of the development of diabetic microangiopathy, and OSAS may also be associated with a high risk of diabetic microangiopathy, providing a reference for a better understanding of the prevention of diabetic microangiopathy.© 2024 Liu, Chang, Lian, Chen, Wang and Fu.",

However, the exact relationship between uric acid levels and psoriasis remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the association between uric acid levels and psoriasis.Observational study participant data (≥16 years, n = 23,489) from NHANES 2003-2014. We conducted analyses using a weighted multiple logistic regression model. Genetic data sets for uric acid levels and psoriasis were obtained from the IEU database. We selected genetically independent loci closely associated with serum uric acid levels as instrumental variables and performed Mendelian randomization analyses using five complementary methods: inverse variance weighting (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode.After adjusting for other covariates, the results revealed no significant association between serum uric acid levels and psoriasis (b = 0.999, 95% CI: 0.998, 1.001, p = 0.275). Subgroup analyses stratified by gender and ethnicity showed no significant association between sUA and psoriasis in any of the subgroups. Furthermore, the MR analysis involved the selection of 227 SNPs that were associated with both sUA and psoriasis. IVW results demonstrated no causal relationship between sUA and psoriasis (OR = 0.282, 95% CI: -0.094-0.657, p = 0.142).Our study suggests that uric acid levels are not significantly causally related to psoriasis. This finding provides valuable insights for the treatment and prevention of psoriasis, indicating that merely reducing uric acid levels may not be an effective strategy to reduce the risk of psoriasis onset.Copyright © 2024 Hu, Wang, Xu, Bai and Tang.",

         "Background: Several observational cohort studies suggested a close correlation between inflammatory bowel disease and erectile dysfunction. Nevertheless, whether there was a causal effect between them remained debatable. In this study, we aimed to detect the underlying causal links between genetically predicted inflammatory bowel disease and the risk of erectile dysfunction. Methods: A bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study was performed to assess the causal link between inflammatory bowel disease and erectile dysfunction. Inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode were utilized to estimate the causality. The top single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with inflammatory bowel disease cases (n = 25,800) and erectile dysfunction cases (n = 1,154) were extracted from the summary genome-wide association study (GWAS) data obtained from a publicly attainable database. MR-PRESSO global outlier test and MR-Egger regression were utilized to explore the horizontal pleiotropy and outlier instrumental variables. Cochran's Q statistic was utilized to detect the heterogeneity. Results: In the forward MR study, the IVW approach demonstrated that genetically determined inflammatory bowel disease exhibited a suggestively causal association with an increased risk of erectile dysfunction (OR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.02-1.21, p = 0.019), and also the genetically determined Crohn's disease was found to be causally associated with an increased risk of erectile dysfunction (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.02-1.17, p = 0.014). However, the MR analysis results showed no significant evidence supporting a causal effect of ulcerative colitis with erectile dysfunction (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.92-1.14, p = 0.679). Furthermore, the reverse MR analysis showed no causal effects of genetically determined erectile dysfunction on inflammatory bowel disease. Additionally, sensitivity analysis demonstrated no pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Conclusion: Our MR analysis substantiated causal links of inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn's disease on erectile dysfunction, which may further elucidate how inflammatory bowel disease impacted the initiation and development of erectile dysfunction, and facilitated the prevention and clinical management of inflammatory bowel disease in individuals with erectile dysfunction.Copyright © 2024 Pan, Sun, Zheng, Liu and Xu.",

         "Background: Observational studies have indicated a potential correlation between glioblastoma and circulating inflammatory proteins. Further investigation is required to establish a causal relationship between these two factors. Methods: We performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary of 91 circulating inflammation-related proteins (N = 14,824) to assess their causal impact on glioblastoma. The GWAS summary data for glioblastoma included 243 cases and 287,137 controls. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was used as the primary analytical method to assess causality. Four additional MR methods [simple mode, MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode] were used to supplement the IVW results. Furthermore, several sensitivity analyses were performed to assess heterogeneity, horizontal pleiotropy, and stability. Reverse MR analysis was also performed. glioblastoma transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analyzed to validate the findings obtained through MR, while pathway and functional enrichment analyses were conducted to predict the potential underlying mechanisms. Results: Our findings from employing the inverse variance weighted method in our forward MR analysis provide robust evidence supporting a potential association between glioblastoma and elevated levels of Cystatin D, as well as decreased levels of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in the circulation. Moreover, our reverse MR analysis revealed that glioblastoma may contribute to increased concentrations of C-X-C motif chemokine 9 (CXCL9) and Interleukin-33 (IL-33) in the bloodstream. Transcriptomic analysis showed that FGF21 expression was inversely associated with the risk of developing glioblastoma, whereas an increased risk was linked to elevated levels of CXCL9 and IL-33. Pathway and functional enrichment analyses suggested that Cystatin D might exert its effects on glioblastoma through intracellular protein transport, whereas FGF21 might affect glioblastoma via glucose response mechanisms. Conclusion: These results indicate that FGF21 is a significant factor in glioblastoma susceptibility. Glioblastoma also affects the expression of inflammatory proteins such as C-X-C motif chemokine 9 and Interleukin-33, providing new insights into the mechanisms of glioblastoma genesis and clinical research.Copyright © 2024 Lin, Gao, Huang, Wu and She.",

To clarify this potential causal linkage, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to explore the bidirectional causality between RA and bronchiectasis.Summary statistics for RA and bronchiectasis were obtained from the IEU OpenGWAS database We employed various methods, including inverse variance weighting (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode, to explore potential causal links between RA and bronchiectasis. Additionally, a series of sensitivity studies, such as Cochran's Q test, MR Egger intercept test, and leave-one-out analysis, were conducted to assess the MR analysis's accuracy further.In the forward MR analysis, the primary analysis indicated that a genetic predisposition to RA correlated with an increased risk of bronchiectasis in European populations (IVW odds ratio (OR): 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20-1.37, p = 1.18E-13). Comparable results were noted in the East Asian subjects (IVW OR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.30-1.34, p = 8.33E-07). The OR estimates from the other four methods were consistent with those obtained from the IVW method. Sensitivity analysis detected no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity. Conversely, in the reverse MR analysis, we found no evidence to support a genetic causality between bronchiectasis and RA in either European or East Asian populations.This study indicates that genetic predisposition to RA correlates with a heightened risk of bronchiectasis in both European and East Asian populations. These results imply that routine screening for bronchiectasis in RA patients could be beneficial, and effective management of RA may contribute to a reduced risk of bronchiectasis. Future research should aim to clarify the underlying mechanisms linking these two conditions.© 2024. The Author(s).",

It is of great significance to discover new drug targets for IPF.We obtained the cis-expression quantitative trait locus (cis-eQTL) of druggable genes from eQTLGen Consortium as exposure and the genome wide association study (GWAS) of IPF from the International IPF Genetics Consortium as outcomes to simulate the effects of drugs on IPF by employing mendelian randomization analysis. Then colocalization analysis was performed to calculate the probability of both cis-eQTL of druggable genes and IPF sharing a causal variant. For further validation, we conducted protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) analysis to reaffirm our findings.The expression of 45 druggable genes was significantly associated with IPF susceptibility at FDR < 0.05. The expression of 23 and 15 druggable genes was significantly associated with decreased forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) in IPF patients, respectively. IPF susceptibility and two significant genes (IL-7 and ABCB2) were likely to share a causal variant. The results of the pQTL analysis demonstrated that high levels of IL-7 in plasma are associated with a reduced risk of IPF (OR = 0.67, 95%CI: 0.47-0.97).IL-7 stands out as the most promising potential drug target to mitigate the risk of IPF. Our study not only sheds light on potential drug targets but also provides a direction for future drug development in IPF.© 2024. The Author(s).",

However, no evidence of causal effects of hypothyroidism, TSH, and FT4 on OC or reverse causality was detected. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated consistent and reliable results, with no significant estimates of heterogeneity or pleiotropy.This study employed MR to establish a correlation between hyperthyroidism and OC risk.

Our Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis investigates the potential connection between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and PCa, aiming to confirm causal links between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), hyperthyroidism, and PCa. Summary statistics from genome-wide association studies provided data on PCa and three AIDs.

IVW revealed a correlation between genetically anticipated RA and PCa, notably in Europeans (OR = 1.03; 95% CI 1.01-1.04, p = 2*10-5). Evidence supported a lower PCa risk in individuals with SLE (OR = 0.94; 95% CI 0.91-0.97, p = 2*10-4) and hyperthyroidism (OR = 0.02; 95% CI 0.001-0.2, p = 2*10-3).

         "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the predominant cause of liver pathology. Current evidence highlights plasma proteins as potential therapeutic targets. However, their mechanistic roles in NAFLD remain unclear. This study investigated the involvement of specific plasma proteins and intermediate risk factors in NAFLD progression. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to examine the association between plasma proteins and NAFLD. Colocalization analysis determined the shared causal variants between the identified proteins and NAFLD. The MR analysis was applied separately to proteins, risk factors, and NAFLD. Mediator shares were computed by detecting the correlations among these elements. Phenome-wide association studies (phewas) were utilized to assess the safety implications of targeting these proteins. Among 1,834 cis-protein quantitative trait loci (cis-pQTLs), after-FDR correction revealed correlations between the plasma levels of four gene-predicted proteins (CSPG3, CILP2, Apo-E, and GCKR) and NAFLD. Colocalization analysis indicated shared causal variants for CSPG3 and GCKR in NAFLD (posterior probability > 0.8). Out of the 22 risk factors screened for MR analysis, only 8 showed associations with NAFLD (p ≤ 0.05), while 4 linked to CSPG3 and GCKR. The mediator shares for these associations were calculated separately. Additionally, reverse MR analysis was performed on the pQTLs, risk factors, and NAFLD, which exhibited a causal relationship with forward MR analysis. Finally, phewas summarized the potential side effects of associated-targeting proteins, including CSPG3 and GCKR. Our research emphasized the potential therapeutic targets for NAFLD and provided modifiable risk factors for preventing NAFLD.© 2024. The Author(s).",

Multiple linear regression evaluated the association between the TyG index and TSH. Additionally, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) using published genome-wide association study data evaluated causality in the association between the TyG index and TSH.Men and women with greater TyG indices had a significantly greater prevalence of thyroid disorders than individuals with the lowest quartile (Q1) of TyG index (p < 0.05). Following adjustment for confounding factors, we observed that a greater TyG index significantly increased the risk of subclinical hypothyroidism in men and women (men: Q2: odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 1.22 [1.07-1.38], p = 0.002; Q3: OR [95% CI] = 1.28 [1.12-1.45], p < 0.001; Q4: OR [95% CI] = 1.29 [1.12-1.50], p = 0.001; women: Q2: OR [95% CI] = 1.25 [1.12-1.39], p < 0.001; Q3: OR [95% CI] = 1.47 [1.31-1.64], p < 0.001; Q4: OR [95% CI] = 1.61 [1.43-1.82], p < 0.001). Only among women was the highest TyG index quartile associated with hypothyroidism (OR [95% CI] = 1.70 [1.15-2.50], p = 0.007). Additionally, in men, the association exists only in the more than adequate iodine intake population. In women, the relationship between the TyG index and thyroid disorders disappears after menopause. Furthermore, the TyG index exhibited a linear positive correlation with TSH levels. The MR analysis results revealed a causal relationship between a genetically determined greater TyG index and increased TSH (inverse-variance weighting (IVW): OR [95% CI] = 1.14 [1.02-1.28], p = 0.020); however, this causal relationship disappeared after adjusting for BMI in multivariable MR (MVMR) analysis (MVMR-IVW: OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.87-1.22, p = 0.739).A greater TyG index is associated with hypothyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism and varies by sex and menopausal status. MR analysis demonstrated that the causal relationship between a genetically determined greater TyG index and elevated TSH levels is confounded or mediated by BMI.© 2024.

         "Observational studies suggested a potential correlation between dietary intake and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but conflicting findings exist and causality remains unclear. Here, we performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate the causal impact of relative intake of (i) carbohydrate, (ii) fat, and (iii) protein on ALS risk.The genome-wide association summary statistics of three dietary macronutrient intake traits and ALS were obtained. Initially, forward and reverse univariable MR (UVMR) analysis were conducted using the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method as the primary approach, supplemented by MR-Egger, weighted median, and maximum likelihood. Subsequently, multivariable MR (MVMR) analysis was performed to assess the independent causal effects of each dietary. Additionally, diverse sensitivity tests were conducted to evaluate the reliability of the MR analyses.The forward UVMR analysis conducted by IVW indicated that relative carbohydrate intake significantly increased ALS risk. Furthermore, results from three other MR methods paralleled those from IVW. However, the other two dietary intake traits did not have a causative impact on ALS risk. The reverse UVMR analysis indicated that ALS did not causatively influence the three dietary intake traits. The MVMR analysis showed that after adjusting for the effects of the other two dietary intake traits, relative carbohydrate intake independently and significantly increased ALS risk. Sensitivity tests indicated no significant heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy.MR analysis supported relative carbohydrate independently increasing ALS risk. Nevertheless, further validation of this finding in future large cohorts is required.Abbreviations: ALS: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; CI: confidence interval; GWAS: genome-wide association study; IV: instrumental variable; IVW: iverse variance weighted; MR: Mendelian randomization; MVMR: multivariable Mendelian randomization; OR: odds ratio; RCT: randomized controlled trial; SNPs: single-nucleotide polymorphisms; UVMR: univariable Mendelian randomization.",

         "Numerous observational studies have reported an association between frailty and atherosclerosis. However, the causal relationship between frailty and the occurrence of atherosclerosis in different anatomical sites remains unclear. we conducted a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study to evaluate the causal relationship between the frailty index (FI), and both systemic atherosclerosis and lipids.We obtained summary statistics from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of various phenotypes, including frailty (n = 175,226), coronary atherosclerosis (n = 56,685), cerebral atherosclerosis (n = 150,765), peripheral arterial disease (PAD) (n = 361,194), atherosclerosis at other sites (n = 17,832), LDL-C (n = 201,678), HDL-C (n = 77,409), and triglycerides (n = 78,700). The primary MR analysis employed the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method. Furthermore, to assess reverse causality, we employed inverse MR and multivariate MR analysis.Genetically predicted FI showed positive associations with the risk of coronary atherosclerosis (OR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.12-1.93) and cerebral atherosclerosis (OR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.05-3.78), with no significant association (p >0.05) applied to peripheral arterial disease and atherosclerosis at other sites. Genetically predicted FI was positively associated with the risk of triglycerides (OR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.08-1.59), negatively associated with the risk of LDL-C (OR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.78-0.97), and showed no significant association with the risk of HDL-C (p >0.05). Furthermore, both reverse MR and multivariate MR analyses demonstrated a correlation between systemic atherosclerosis, lipids, and increased FI.Our study elucidated that genetically predicted FI is associated with the risk of coronary atherosclerosis and cerebral atherosclerosis by the MR analysis method, and they have a bidirectional causal relationship. Moreover, genetically predicted FI was causally associated with triglyceride and LDL-C levels. Further understanding of this association is crucial for optimizing medical practice and care models specifically tailored to frail populations.Copyright: © 2024 Xu et al.

         "Unhealthy sleep patterns are common during pregnancy and have been associated with an increased risk of developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs) in observational studies. However, the causality underlying these associations remains uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate the potential causal association between seven sleep traits and the risk of HDPs using a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics were obtained from the FinnGen consortium, UK Biobank, and other prominent consortia, with a focus on individuals of European ancestry. The primary analysis utilized an inverse-variance-weighted MR approach supplemented by sensitivity analyses to mitigate potential biases introduced by pleiotropy. Furthermore, a two-step MR framework was employed for mediation analyses.The data analyzed included 200 000-500 000 individuals for each sleep trait, along with approximately 15 000 cases of HDPs. Genetically predicted excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) exhibited a significant association with an increased risk of HDPs [odds ratio (OR) 2.96, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.40-6.26], and the specific subtype of preeclampsia/eclampsia (OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.06-8.3). Similarly, genetically predicted obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was associated with a higher risk of HDPs (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.09-1.47). Sensitivity analysis validated the robustness of these associations. Mediation analysis showed that BMI mediated approximately 25% of the association between EDS and HDPs, while mediating up to approximately 60% of the association between OSA and the outcomes. No statistically significant associations were observed between other genetically predicted sleep traits, such as chronotype, daytime napping, sleep duration, insomnia, snoring, and the risk of HDPs.Our findings suggest a causal association between two sleep disorders, EDS and OSA, and the risk of HDPs, with BMI acting as a crucial mediator. EDS and OSA demonstrate promise as potentially preventable risk factors for HDPs, and targeting BMI may represent an alternative treatment strategy to mitigate the adverse impact of sleep disorders.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

         "Neurocognitive and psychiatric disorders have been proved that they can comorbid more often with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) than general population. However, the potential causal association between these disorders and iNPH has not been assessed. Thus, our study aims to investigate the causal relationship between them based on a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.Random effects of the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method were conducted to obtain the causal association among the neurocognitive disorders, psychiatric disorders, and iNPH. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 12 neurocognitive and psychiatric disorders were downloaded via the OpenGWAS database, GWAS Catalog, and Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, whereas GWAS data of iNPH were obtained from the FinnGen consortium round 9 release, with 767 cases and 375,610 controls of European ancestry. We also conducted the sensitivity analysis in these significant causal inferences using weighted median model, Cochrane's Q test, MR-Egger regression, MR Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier detect and the leave-one-out analysis.For most of the neurocognitive and psychiatric disorders, no causal association was established between them and iNPH. We have found that iNPH (odds ratio [OR] = 1.030, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.011-1.048, p = .001) is associated with increased risk for schizophrenia, which failed in validation of sensitivity analysis. Notably, genetically predicted Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with increased risk of iNPH (OR = 1.256, 95% CI: 1.045-1.511, p = .015).Our study has revealed the potential causal effect in which PD associated with an increased risk of iNPH.

To investigate the causal associations between H. pylori infection and EoE, we performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.Firstly, we conducted both univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Furthermore, a two-step MR was carried out to ascertain the potential underlying pathways of these associations, particularly the involvement of inflammatory cytokines. We employed the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method as the main analysis in our MR study. To enhance the credibility of the results, we also conducted several sensitivity analyses.Our study demonstrated a noteworthy correlation between genetically predicted anti-H. pylori IgG antibody levels and a reduced risk of EoE (OR=0.325, 95% CI=0.165-0.643, P value=0.004, adj p value=0.009). No significant causal associations were detected between other H. pylori antibodies and EoE in our study. When it comes to multivariable MR analysis controlling for education attainment, household income, and deprivation individually, the independent causal impact of anti-H. pylori IgG on EoE persisted. Surprisingly, the two-step MR analysis indicated that inflammatory factors (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-17, and IFN-γ) did not appear to mediate the protective effect of H. pylori infection against EoE.Findings suggested that among the range of H. pylori-related antibodies, anti-H. pylori IgG antibody is the sole causal factor associated with protection against EoE. Certain inflammatory factors may not be involved in mediating this association. These findings make a significant contribution to advancing our understanding of the pathogenesis of EoE and its evolving etiology.Copyright © 2024 Zhu, Yang, Han, Peng and Zhu.",

Additionally, we employed linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) to assess genetic correlations between ADHD and RLS using genetic data.Our MR results supports a causal effect from ADHD (as exposure) to RLS (as outcome) (inverse variance weighted OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.08-1.34, p = 0.001). Conversely, we found no a causal association from RLS to ADHD (inverse variance weighted OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.99-1.09, p = 0.11). LDSC analysis did not detect a significant genetic correlation between RLS and ADHD (Rg = 0.3, SE = 0.16, p = 0.068). Furthermore, no evidence supported a causal relationship between peripheral iron deficiency and the RLS or ADHD onset. However, RLS may have been associated with a genetic predisposition to reduced serum ferritin levels (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.00-1.04, p = 0.047).This study suggests that ADHD is an independent risk factor for RLS, while RLS may confer a genetic predisposition to reduced serum ferritin levels.The GWAS summary data utilized originated from populations of European ancestry, limiting the generalizability of conclusions to other populations.The potential co-occurrence of RLS in individuals with ADHD should be considered during diagnosis and treatment. Moreover, iron supplementation may be beneficial for alleviating RLS symptoms.Copyright © 2024 Xiao, Shi, Lan, Hu, Guan, Liang, Zhou, Huang, Chen and Zhou.",

         "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a heritable condition with an as yet unclear etiology. Various factors, such as genetics, lifestyle, environment, inflammation, insulin resistance, hyperandrogenism, iron metabolism, and gut microbiota, have been proposed as potential contributors to PCOS. Nevertheless, a systematic assessment of modifiable risk factors and their causal effects on PCOS is lacking. This study aims to establish a comprehensive profile of modifiable risk factors for PCOS by utilizing a two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) framework.After identifying over 400 modifiable risk factors, we employed a two-sample MR approach, including the Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) method, Weighted Median method, and MR-Egger, to investigate their causal associations with PCOS. The reliability of our estimates underwent rigorous examination through sensitivity analyses, encompassing Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept analysis, leave-one-out analysis, and funnel plots.We discovered that factors such as smoking per day, smoking initiation, body mass index, basal metabolic rate, waist-to-hip ratio, whole body fat mass, trunk fat mass, overall health rating, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (22:6n-3) in blood, monounsaturated fatty acids, other polyunsaturated fatty acids apart from 18:2 in blood, omega-3 fatty acids, ratio of bisallylic groups to double bonds, omega-9 and saturated fatty acids, total lipids in medium VLDL, phospholipids in medium VLDL, phospholipids in very large HDL, triglycerides in very large HDL, the genus Oscillibacter, the genus Alistipes, the genus Ruminiclostridium 9, the class Mollicutes, and the phylum Tenericutes, showed a significant effect on heightening genetic susceptibility of PCOS. In contrast, factors including fasting insulin interaction with body mass index, sex hormone-binding globulin, iron, ferritin, SDF1a, college or university degree, years of schooling, household income, the genus Enterorhabdus, the family Bifidobacteriaceae, the order Bifidobacteriales, the class Actinobacteria, and the phylum Actinobacteria were determined to reduce risk of PCOS.This study innovatively employs the MR method to assess causal relationships between 400 modifiable risk factors and the susceptibility of PCOS risk. It supports causal links between factors like smoking, BMI, and various blood lipid levels and PCOS. These findings offer novel insights into potential strategies for the management and treatment of PCOS.Copyright © 2024 Zhao, Pang, Fang, Yan, Yang, Deng, Ma, Lv, Li, Tu and Zou.",

         "Previous studies have shown that pregnant women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) tend to have a higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, but the potential causal role remained unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the causal relationship between SLE and some common pregnancy complications and outcomes using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR).The genetic tools were derived from genome-wide association studies of SLE and pregnancy complications and outcomes. MR analysis was performed using inverse variance weighting as primary method. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the results. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 200 pregnant women with SLE and a control group of pregnant women delivering at Tongji Hospital.In the results, we found that genetic susceptibility to SLE was associated with a higher risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.028, 95% CI: 1.006-1.050), premature delivery (OR = 1.039, 95% CI: 1.013-1.066), polyhydramnios (OR = 1.075, 95% CI: 1.004-1.151) and premature rupture of membranes (OR = 1.030, 95% CI: 1.001-1.060). Some of the retrospective analysis results align with the findings from the MR analysis, indicating that pregnant women with SLE have a higher risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus and preterm birth. Additionally, although MR analysis did not reveal a causal relationship between SLE and preeclampsia/eclampsia, retrospective analysis discovered that SLE pregnant women are more susceptible to developing preeclampsia/eclampsia (OR = 2.935, 95% CI: 1.118-7.620).Our study findings suggest a potential causal relationship between SLE and increased risks of gestational diabetes and preterm delivery. Clinical data indicate that pregnant women with SLE are more prone to developing preeclampsia/eclampsia. Clinicians need to be vigilant about the occurrence of these conditions when managing pregnant women with SLE.© 2024 Zhu et al.",

         "Obesity has been confirmed to be associated with cardiovascular disease, but previous studies have focused on adults, and whether childhood obesity is associated with cardiovascular disease in adulthood needs further research.This Mendelian randomization (MR) study aimed to investigate the associations of childhood and adult body mass index (BMI) with the risk of chronic heart failure (CHF) and ischemic stroke (IS).Independent genetic instruments, demonstrating a strong association with exposure at the genome-wide significance level (P < 5 × 10-8), were carefully selected from comprehensive genome-wide association studies conducted within relevant European populations. Summary-level data for CHF and IS were obtained from the EBI database and large consortia of European population. To enhance robustness and generalizability, the analysis was replicated in an East Asian population cohort.According to a MR analysis based on a European population, a higher adult BMI was associated with an increased risk of CHF [(odds ratio (OR) 1.594, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.483-1.713)] and IS (OR 1.163, 95%CI 1.096-1.233). In addition, higher childhood BMI level was associated with a higher risk of CHF (OR 1.323, 95%CI 1.153-1.524).and the effect was mainly driven by adult BMI. Replication analyses of adult BMI in East Asian populations showed consistent findings that adult BMI was associated with the risk of CHF (OR 2.167, 95%CI 1.786-2.630) and IS (OR 1.259, 95%CI 1.128-1.406).Our study findings provide compelling evidence for the significant influence of adult BMI on the occurrence of CHF and IS. Furthermore, our observations suggest that the positive association between childhood BMI and the risk of CHF in adulthood can largely be attributed to individuals who maintain obesity into later life.© 2024 The Authors.

         "Observational studies have found a potential link between the use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) and a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) development. Platelets were the great source of amyloid-β (Aβ) and involved in the development of AD. This study aimed to assess the correlation between antidiabetic agents and platelet characteristics, hoping to provide a potential mechanism of TZDs neuroprotection in AD.Drug-targeted Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed to systematically illustrate the long-term effects of antidiabetic agents on platelet characteristics. Four antidiabetic agent targets were considered. Positive control analysis for type 2 diabetes (T2D) was conducted to validate the selection of instrumental variables (IVs). Colocalization analysis was used to further strengthen the robustness of the results.Positive control analysis showed an association of four antidiabetic agents with lower risk of T2D, which was consistent with their mechanisms of action and previous evidence from clinical trials. Genetically proxied TZDs were associated with lower platelet count (β[IRNT] = -0.410 [95 % CI -0.533 to -0.288], P = 5.32E-11) and a lower plateletcrit (β[IRNT] = -0.344 [95 % CI -0.481 to -0.206], P = 1.04E-6). Colocalization suggested the posterior probability of hypothesis 4 (PPH4) > 0.8, which further strengthened the MR results.Genetically proxied TZDs were causally associated with lower platelet characteristics, particularly platelet count and plateletcrit, providing insight into the involvement of platelet-related pathways in the neuroprotection of TZDs against AD. Future studies are warranted to reveal the underlying molecular mechanism of TZDs' neuroprotective effects through platelet pathways.© 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

         "Glucagon-like-peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) have transformed type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity management. Multiple regulatory agencies are investigating reported associations between GLP1-RA and increased suicide attempts (SA), but observational data may be prone to confounding. Randomised control trials (RCT) of GLP-1RA were largely undertaken in people at lower risk of SA. Real-world data suggest semaglutide use associates with reduced suicidal ideation and depression but was under-powered to statistically assess risk of SA. Mendelian randomisation (MR) leverages genetic instrument(s) to infer potential causal association between an exposure and an outcome. We undertook MR using missense variants in the gene encoding GLP1R that improve glycemia, lower T2D risk and/or lower BMI, to investigate potential causal association between GLP-1RA and SA. In people of European ancestry, MR did not find evidence genetically proxied GLP1RA increased SA in a general population cohort: (rs10305492, exposure: HbA1c, odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38, 0.41-4.62, p = .60), (rs10305492, exposure: FG, OR 1.27, 0.52-3.13, p = .60) and (rs1042044, exposure BMI, OR 0.30, 0.06-1.48) with concordant results in a multi-ancestry SA case-control cohort. In conclusion, we did not find MR evidence that increased GLP-1RA impacts SA. This awaits confirmation with RCT and real-world data.© 2024 World Obesity Federation.",

         "This comprehensive investigation delved into the intricate causal interplay existing between cardiovascular-related plasma proteins and the susceptibility to colorectal cancer, leveraging the robust framework of Mendelian randomization, and employed expression profiling and survival analysis to unravel the latent clinical worth embedded within pertinent gene expressions.Protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) of 85 cardiovascular proteins were employed as instrumental variables to investigate the causal relationship between proteins and CRC risk using a Mendelian randomization approach. Causal inferences were graded as strong, intermediate or weak based on statistical checks. Drug-target MR examined VEGF receptors for their potential as therapeutic targets for colorectal cancer. Differential expression analysis, diagnostic ROC curves, and survival analyses were performed for identified proteins using RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) colorectal cancer cohort.Using cis-pQTLs, LOX-1, VEGF-A and OPG were associated with increased CRC risk (strong evidence), while PTX3, TNF-R2 and MMP-7 were protective (strong evidence). Pan-pQTL analysis found MMP-10 increased risk (intermediate evidence) and ADM increased risk (weak evidence). Drug-target MR found VEGF R1 may be promising therapeutic targets. Differential expression analysis revealed seven genes encoding the identified proteins were dysregulated in tumors. ROC analysis showed five gene expression had high diagnostic accuracy. KM analysis showed four genes had prognostic value.This large-scale MR study implicates several cardiovascular proteins in CRC susceptibility and progression. Findings highlight roles for VEGF signaling and extracellular matrix regulation. Results nominate specific proteins as potential diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets warranting further investigation.© 2024. The Author(s).",

         "Several hematologic traits have been suggested to potentially contribute to the formation and rupture of intracranial aneurysms (IA). The purpose of this study is to explore the causal association between hematologic traits and the risk of IA. To explore the causal association between hematologic traits and the risk of IA, we employed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Two independent summary-level GWAS data were used for preliminary and replicated MR analyses. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was employed as the primary method in the MR analyses. The stabilities of the results were further confirmed by a meta-analysis. In the preliminary MR analysis, hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration (p = 0.0047), basophil count (p = 0.0219) had a suggestive inverse causal relationship with the risk of aneurysm-associated subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). The monocyte percentage of white cells (p = 0.00956) was suggestively positively causally correlated with the risk of aSAH. In the replicated MR analysis, only the monocyte percentage of white cells (p = 0.00297) remained consistent with the MR results in the preliminary analysis. The hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, and basophil count no longer showed significant causal relationship (p > 0.05). Meta-analysis results further confirmed that only the MR result of monocyte percentage of white cells reached significance in the random effect model and fixed effect model. None of the 25 hematologic traits was causally associated with the risk of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (uIA). This study revealed a suggestive positive association between the monocyte percentage of white cells and the risk of aSAH. This finding contributes to a better understanding that monocytes/macrophages could participate in the risk of aSAH.© 2024. The Author(s).",

         "The evidence connecting polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to biliary problems is still highly contested and speculative despite the fact that biliary diseases are common and PUFAs have long been studied for their potential health benefits. This work used Mendelian randomization (MR) techniques in conjunction with genome-wide association study (GWAS) data to clarify the causal relationships between PUFAs and biliary tract diseases.We compiled data on PUFAs, including Omega-3 fatty acids, Omega-6 fatty acids, and the ratio of Omega-6 to Omega-3 fatty acids (Omega-6:Omega-3), using GWAS. MR was used to examine biliary tract problems (cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, gallbladder cancer, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and disorders of gallbladder, biliary tract and pancreas). Single nucleotide polymorphisms significantly associated with PUFAs were selected as instrumental variables to estimate causal effects on biliary tract diseases. The final results were analyzed using five MR analysis techniques. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was used as the primary outcome. And IVW was utilized in conjunction with the other MR analysis techniques (MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode). Additionally, we evaluated heterogeneity and horizontal multiplicity using the MR-Egger intercept test and Cochrane's Q test, respectively. Finally, to increase the accuracy and precision of the study outcomes, we carried out a number of sensitivity analyses.We found that Omega-3 fatty acids reduced the risk of cholecystitis (OR: 0.851, P = 0.009), cholelithiasis (OR: 0.787, P = 8.76e-5), and disorders of gallbladder, biliary tract and pancreas (OR: 0.842, P = 1.828e-4) but increased the primary biliary cholangitis (OR: 2.220, P = 0.004). There was no significant association between Omega-3 fatty acids and risk of gallbladder cancer (OR: 3.127, P = 0.530) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (OR: 0.919, P = 0.294). Omega-6 fatty acids were associated with a reduced risk of cholecystitis (OR: 0.845, P = 0.040). However, they were not linked to an increased or decreased risk of cholelithiasis (OR: 0.878, P = 0.14), gallbladder cancer (OR: 4.670, P = 0.515), primary sclerosing cholangitis (OR: 0.993, P = 0.962), primary cholestatic biliary cholangitis (OR: 1.404, P = 0.509), or disorders of gallbladder, biliary tract and pancreas. Omega-6:Omega-3 fatty acids were linked to a greater risk of cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, and disorders of gallbladder, biliary tract and pancreas (OR:1.168, P = 0.009, OR:1.191, P = 1.60e-6, and OR:1.160, P = 4.11e-6, respectively). But (OR: 0.315, P = 0.010) was linked to a decreased risk of primary biliary cholangitis. Not linked to risk of primary sclerosing cholangitis (OR: 1.079, P = 0.078) or gallbladder cancer (OR: 0.046, P = 0.402). According to the MR-Egger intercept, our MR examination did not appear to be impacted by any pleiotropy (all P > 0.05). Additionally, sensitivity studies validated the accuracy of the calculated causation.Inconsistent causative relationships between PUFAs and biliary tract diseases were revealed in our investigation. However, Omega-3 fatty acids were found to causally lower the risk of cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, and disorders of gallbladder, biliary tract and pancreas. Omega-3 fatty acids increased the risk of primary biliary cholangitis in a causative way. Omega-3 fatty acids with the risk of gallbladder cancer and primary sclerosing cholangitis did not have any statistically significant relationships. Omega-6 fatty acids were not significantly causally connected with the risk of cholelithiasis, gallbladder cancer, primary sclerosing cholangitis, or disorders of gallbladder, biliary tract and pancreas. However, they did play a causative role in lowering the risk of cholecystitis. Omega-6:Omega-3 fatty acids decreased the risk of primary biliary cholangitis but increased the risk of cholecystitis, gallstone disease, and disorders of gallbladder, biliary tract and pancreas. They had no effect on the risk of gallbladder cancer or primary sclerosing cholangitis. Therefore, additional research should be done to examine the probable processes mediating the link between polyunsaturated fatty acids and the risk of biliary tract diseases.Copyright © 2024 The Authors.
